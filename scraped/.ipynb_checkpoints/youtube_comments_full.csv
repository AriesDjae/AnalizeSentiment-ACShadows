I think people feel like if they connect with someones ideas about something, they also have to adapt those ideas instead of creating their own. Almost as if they aren't autonomous in their free thinking. Ive put 5 hours into this game and I haven't gotten Yasuke. Not because I don't want to, but im enjoying the free roam and stealth gameplay. As an avid AC fan, I loved doing that from the very get-go. It's a peace of mind to be able to stealth out a whole place to get recon and sabotage it to help my offense. Maybe I've got a lot time on my hands, but also, maybe I don't care for linear gameplay all the time. 

I think your takes make sense and I agreed with a few of them. But I also think this game is doing so well because it is objectively appealing to people who fell in love with AC years ago. Something that Mirage could not do. I think this will go down as one AC's top titles.",147,0,[]

,7 bulan yang lalu (diedit),7 bulan yang lalu (diedit),"So I just came here to say that after paying one month of Ubisoft + just to try AC: Shadows, and after playing it for about two hours, I think the moment has come for me to bid farewell to one of my favourite franchises ever, one that has offered me great gaming experiences since 2007, but that unfortunately stopped after Origins.  That was the last AC game I really enjoyed and finished, cause even though Odyssey was really entertaining, I just didn't feel motivated enough to complete it and I think I reached a dead end where there were hundreds of side quests but I couldn't find the way to progress through the main quest... not sure if it was a glitch or something but I don't care anymore.  I tried valhalla but after two hours I stopped playing, and something similar happened with shadows.  It's not only the lack of ""assassin's creed""-like things to do, the essesnce of the game is now completely lost and the more you progress, the more lame/boring/unnecessary side quests appear to try and keep you playing and playing and playing as an errand boy/girl in an infinite world, and then if you can stand the tediousness then you may eventually see the ending of the game(a cutscene or something).  More linear games with more engaging content like the first ones, black flag, Unity and even Syndicate are now in the past and unfortunately corporate decisions and money are now above art, not only in this game but in many.  I will revisit the older games at some point though, to remember those good time I had when I played them for the first time,  and hope the first one gets a remake as well tho I don't remember playing a remake of a game that surpassed the experience of what the original made me feel.

That's what I came into Shadows looking for, and it has delivered, just as well as Odyssey and Origins did. It is far from a perfect game, and the criticisms here are valid - dialogue is really forced and cringy at times, side quests can get repetitive, and I HATE microtransactions in single-player games.

It's pretty clear that Ubisoft as a company does not care at all to make good games anymore. They pioneered the genre and then ran it into the ground.

Sony and Sucker Punch basicaly proved you can make a profit on this type of game while also making a good experience (and without microtransactions).

They're even being outdone by smaller dev with significantly less resources these days (Wukong for instance may not have been open world technically but from what it seems had significantly more depth and complexity than this).",8,6,"[""The main difference is that Tsushima was a passion project for Sucker Punch, a love letter to a country and a genre. For Ubisoft it's just another yearly installment of a cash cow. \nAC felt like a genuine attempt at being awesone when Patrice Désillets was the creative force behind the games. Since he left that it's on life support. Some good installments here and there but not one of them comes close to what AC 2 was."", ""They could've also copied elements from Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, as that game also had incredibly amazing blends of stealth, combat, progression mechanics, and player choices."", "" @TheSoulExplorer  Yup. Basically proof that the issue is not nostalgic fans only wanting the old games, there's proof positive that it's Ubisoft having no creative integrity anymore"", "" @NexusKin  Agreed. Another game proving that feudal Japanese inspired settings and gameplay have mass appeal and that Ubisoft just doesn't care anymore"", ' @arthurdurham  AC was also being handled by a core team back then. Easy to focus with less pressure of meeting fiscal demands because it was still an ""unproven"" new IP. Now it\'s a massive franchise with monetary goals to achieve. These games are now made by multiple studios across the globe. Handling a sizeable team within the same building can be challenging. Can you imagine a director trying to do the same with thousands of people via conference calls where everybody needs to be on the same page? It has to be a nightmare. But it needs to happen so shareholders make their millions. \n\nSucker Punch still is one of the smaller studios under the Playstation umbrella. They don\'t have the resources to work on multiple games at the same time. The downside is that other IP\'s need to hault when they\'re working on a specific one. The upside is that their games are at least focused.', ' @TheSoulExplorer ”yearly instalment” bro this is only the 3rd game in like 6 years…\n\nIgnoring that, this game is amazing idc what anyone says']"

,5 bulan yang lalu,5 bulan yang lalu,"Look here's the thing....the game is actually enjoyable! BUT it was a rollercoaster ride in the beginning, I hated it, absolutely hated it in the beginning because it doesn't explain a lot of the things or mechanics and is unforgivingly difficult unless you make a few tweaks in the settings. Also you got to know how to play. You can't just play this game like any other AC game, this game has a very specific set of mechanics that you only start feeling comfortable in after you get used to them in 20 hours or so of gameplay. It does take quite a bit to get into the flow but once you do.....Damn this game becomes enjoyable. Great acting, pretty okay writing except for the ending which was a slap in the face. 

The ending is basically a plug to an expansion game, it does not have a proper or satisfying ending. But the journey was amazing. When you ride in the breeze and stand on top of a cliff or waterfall watching the wind shake the branches of red maple trees, the feeling is just pure magic.  So, to sum it up, fun gameplay once you get used to it, terrible ending but likeable characters. I did find myself caring deeply about Naoe or Jungiro or Tomiko or Yasuke. The characters are pretty flushed out but the best part is the chemistry between the characters which was amazing. Also, Japan in this game is incredibly picture perfect beautiful.",1,0,[]

Even in AC2, which everyone praises for the story, I honestly thought the story felt quite fragmented, not so coherent, and partly also not so easy to understand. One of the best in the AC series, yes, and I loved to follow the aging character development. But not so good, in my opinion, compared to other more narrative games.

I haven't come across any terrible voice acting as of yet, and I've enjoyed the combat and stealth mechanics so far. It's not groundbreaking but I can't remember the last game I played that had groundbreaking stealth.. maybe TLOU2.
World is definitely gorgeous.

I never played Odyssey or Origins. I hated Valhalla, just couldn't get into it all, hated the combat, stealth felt wrong as a viking. But Shadows so far has been enjoyable. It's £55 in the UK, which to be honest is pretty reasonable in my opinion considering a lot of PS5 games release at 70 or higher. But hey, it's early days, maybe I'll hit a wall!

Assassins Creed Odyssey was my favorite.

I still cant bring myself to buy this game yet.

Really Ubisoft need to think about the lore of this game and what they have built linking the old to drive the new, similar to Stargate TV show.

The next iteration of NPCs and side quests will have to be AI generated plot lines that increase immersion and gives someone 6 months free access in order to complete main story line  but gives the player immersed in the ever changing world they are in offering new experiences all the time , including people wanting to roleplay work functions making it the best MMO they can.

,3 bulan yang lalu,3 bulan yang lalu,"Honestly I prefer male protagonists but I’m impressed with how they portray Naoe as a warrior so far (I am about 4 hours in). I find it immersion breaking when shows, movies, and video games especially portray female warriors as physically strong if not stronger than the average male warriors. Surprisingly, and refreshingly I might add, that’s not the case with Naoe. I haven’t unlocked Yasuke yet so idk if it changes but so far in every instance where she gets into close combat with a male warrior she gets over powered significantly. She actually has to fight smart and use her opponents body weight against them using momentum. It is so satisfying she’s not  a 115 pound super human who can over power a 175-215 lb solid man. So yeah I’m surprised to say it but I’m enjoying it so far. I was never going to buy this game but and when I found out Yasuke couldn’t parkour I had already given up hope of even playing it. I prefer how the did it in Odyssey and Valhalla. For those who always want to know why I prefer playing as male it’s because I’m a male and I find it more immersive. Just as a lot of boys prefer playing with G.I. Joes rather than Barbies. So I was bummed that Yasuke got the short end of the stick seeing as the best part of Assassins Creed is the stealth and traversal. Especially the parkour traversal. It’s like spider man without web swinging. I’ve learned that they updated Yasuke’s parkour mechanics to give him more parkour than he ever did but I haven’t unlocked him yet so I wouldn’t know. That’s another thing too they make it seem like you can choose him from the beginning but it’s become clear how much of an afterthought he was that he has to be unlocked. According to some people it’s 10-25 hours in before you can even unlock him lol anyways so far the writing is a little cringe but nothing too cringe and like I said Noae’s portrayal as a warrior is so damn refreshing I hope media as a whole can take note of what a realistic badass female warrior should look like.",0,0,[]

I have a hard time understanding what is side content and what is main objective because there’s no quest log! It’s so frustrating to me. Valhalla had me hooked immediately because the characters were intriguing. This is just boring and I’m sad because I was so excited. Shadows is a ten in graphics and 4 in game story and repetitive quests that were rinse and repeat. It’s a grind. I give the game a 6.5,1,0,[]

The world is absolutely beautiful and I completely agree with the review on this video. The game is jaw dropping to look at Valhalla was the same way, but as Ubisofts new motto is rinse and repeat, they made another game that is undoubtably, visually stunning, but empty and soulless the game has no flare. If you will no passion after you get the combat out of your system and all of the joy goes away after being a stealthy assassin 
 for the first time and you’ve done the same mission 20 times over the game really just starts to feel like a boring endless grind. You really do get put into that robot mode. It becomes less playing the game and more muscle memory doing the same same combo is over and over again, fighting the same group of bandits on a different season the game faults from everything it’s modern counterparts have faltered from micro transactions in a single player game, which is absolutely unacceptable and is a real Boner killer for anyone that wants a clean experience horrible and bland, voice acting, and repetitive and dull missions at least after a while I will give them credit or credit is due. You can tell they definitely tried with this game but trying doesn’t mean they learned from previous mistakes I really wish I could say that they made a phenomenal game here. They definitely didn’t make a bad one, but my final verdict is no don’t buy this game save your money and if you haven’t already played it, go by ghosts of Tsushima",2,0,[]

Its just another RPG style AC game with low effort quests, weapons, armor, rpg mechanics, story, written characters, dialogues, facial animations, parkour etc. The list goes on. 

Its crazy to me that AC Unity is still the most impressive AC game to this date in terms of technical innovation such as npc density as a Ps4 game or facial animations and parkour. The game had other problems, but it is still ahead of modern AC games in many ways. AC II, BH, Revelations were peak for the series in terms of story and Black Flag was the most fun gameplay wise. 

They tried something new with Origins (nothing special at all in my opinion) and since then every game feels exactly the same. Its just more and more low quality garbage. The only thing Ubisoft gets right is how beautiful buildings or landscapes look. Thats literally the only praise I can give to them.

People are even defending the free battle pass in a fking single player game. The real question should be why you dont get rewarded with all of these battle pass rewards for exploration, killing bosses etc instead.

But let’s not forget — Ghost of Tsushima was originally developed for the PS4, while Assassin’s Creed is being built straight for current-gen consoles. I used to love the AC series, but they really lost me when they dumbed down the climbing system to the point where scaling viewpoints meant just holding down two buttons.

There used to be some real gameplay challenge in those climbing puzzles, and it felt genuinely satisfying when you finally reached the top. Now? It just feels like a chore.

Black Flag was still a fantastic game, but let’s be honest — that was mostly thanks to the ship battles and pirate vibes. Then came Origins with its clunky knockoff of the Dark Souls combat system, and it only went downhill from there.

I might give Shadows a shot... once it hits the bargain bin for twenty bucks. Unless Ghost of Yotei is out by then — in which case, it’s game over.",0,0,[]
