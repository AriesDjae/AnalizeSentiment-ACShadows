"Strange_Music","2025-03-31","[The seasons changing in Shadows is a great RPG mechanic] Game: Assassin's Creed: Shadows 

I spent about 50 hrs visiting all the viewpoints before starting the MQ in Shadows and it took about 2 in-game years.

I've never thought, ""I've come a long way in a couple of years"" in an RPG before and I think it'd be a stellar mechanic to adopt in other titles.

It's not a perfect system - you can manually set the season forward or it'll automatically change with fast travel, but it gave a unique sense of depth to those first 50 hours. 

I wasn't expecting this mechanic to give weight to the passage of time but it  felt like Naoe was more *seasoned* after I was done traveling to every viewpoint. 

Would love to see the seasons change in a more traditional sword and sorcery RPG setting.","7666","post"

Their ugly character surfaced, or more like was allowed to surface because the general hate cloud above this game. Hating on the game was the socially acceptable thing to do, and ho boy did they take advantage of that.

And I'm Talking about blatant r*cism, bias and openly admitting to wanting tens of thousands of people to lose their job.

I literally see comments with thousands of likes that are along the line of ""Assassin's Creed steal your wallet"" or ""yasuke is gonna be a loot hoarder"" or the classic ""ofc he's destroying other people's property, just like irl"" (to the environmental destruction)

Not only that but the nitpicking is insane. A certain slimy goober who has wayyyy to much influence considering he's literally one of the filthiest people alive, sucks at video games in general and has had borderline N*zi views.

Game gas meditation minigame and settlement building minigame? ""Why is this even in the game?""

Game has animal painting activity? ""Why is this even in the game? I can't kill the birddddddd?""

Like Jesus Christ. It's literally clinging to every single ""issue"" to make the game look worse.

I'm just sick and tired of this, not because I care about his worthless opinion, but because it will actually influence the sales of the game in a bad way. He's one of the biggest streamers in the plantet.

P.s. mods, please for the love of god, don't delete this! It's a very real issue and I feel like the community needs to discuss it! Thanks for your understanding","5916","post"

In this Reconstruction-era Assassin’s Creed, gamers would play as a Black man who had been formerly enslaved in the South and moved west to start a new life. Recruited by the series’ Assassins, he would return to the South to fight for justice in a conflict that would, among other things, see him confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan.

>Three sources told Game File that word filtered through the company last July that management in Paris had stopped development of the game for two reasons: 1) online backlash that spring to the reveal of Yasuke, a historically-inspired Black samurai, as a protagonist in the company’s then-upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows; and 2) concern that the political climate in the United States was becoming increasingly tense. “Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short,” one source familiar with the game and its cancellation told Game File.","2710","post"

The improvements across the board are felt immediately, bringing about a significant amount of much-needed change to the formula.

# Selling / Dismantling multiple items

We know you've been hard at work exploring every corner of Feudal Japan, and that means you've filled your pockets with resources and loot.

To help you save time when trading with merchants, we've added the option to tag and sell/dismantle multiple items in shops, or when dismantling gear at the Forge in the Hideout.

"calibur66","2025-04-01","The thing that made me actually appreciate the seasons changing, other than the great visuals, is that it can actually affect how you play.

Atleast as Naoe, enemies can spot you more easily when you're hiding in bushes in winter because the foliage is dead, but they seem to be worse at hearing you move thanks to the snow and frozen lakes and rivers can give you another avenue for engaging, or act as a hazard.

Same seems to go for Autumn where its raining more often so you're harder to spot but the puddles make you louder.

These aspect don't always work perfectly, (tbh I don't think I've ever seen stealth mechanics work perfectly every time in a game), but it does add to the feel of the game a great deal.","1736","comment"

>Ghost of Yōtei is a work that confirms Sucker Punch's maturity in the field of narrative video games. It is not simply an ideal sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, but a project with its own personality, rooted in a less traveled and explored historical and cultural context and made unique by a strong spiritual and natural component. Mount Yōtei and Hokkaidō become not only evocative settings, but active protagonists in the story, blending geography, myth, and introspection into an original narrative fabric. From a gameplay perspective, the title refines the tried-and-tested formula, enriching it with environmental dynamics, new weapons and approaches linked to Ainu culture, and introducing sequences that combine action and spirituality. The artistic and technical direction is once again of the highest standard, exploiting the potential of PlayStation 5 not as a mere display of power, but as a tool to convey atmosphere, consistency and charm. The more meditative and measured pace of the game is a deliberate stylistic choice that sets Ghost of Yōtei apart from the frenzy of many contemporary open-world games: an approach that may divide audiences, but one that reinforces the consistency with the narrative tone and aesthetics of the work. Overall, Ghost of Yōtei stands out as a chapter that broadens the scope of the series, offering a dynamic experience that you can decide for yourself how to approach, combining entertainment and cultural reflection. It is a video game that demands time and attention, but rewards you with a believable world, a story rich in meaning, and a strong identity.

>With some truly wonderful writing and an engaging pair of protagonists, I adored Assassin’s Creed Shadows. I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined.

>Assassin's Creed Shadows is the best installment in the series for a long time and brings many fresh ideas to the table. The setting is breathtaking, the variety in the missions is great and the gameplay feels very well thought out. The interaction between Yasuke and Naoe in particular creates an interesting dynamic. While Yasuke excels in combat, Naoe offers probably the best parcours gameplay the series has ever had. Traversal with Yasuke, the actual story and the typical open-world problems do tarnish the whole thing somewhat, but the series certainly wasn't this good for a while.

>Assassin's Creed Shadows is another notch in the belt of this illustrious series. Sneaking and stabbing as Naoe or duelling foes in honourable combat as Yasuke, the duel protagonists are a genius addition to all the things we love about Assassin's Creed. Even though I haven't gelled with the more recent huge open-world AC titles, I leave my time with Assassin's Creed Shadows with renewed excitement for the series thanks to a more manageable map size and a great story. Add in the beautiful backdrop of medieval Japan throughout the seasons, and you've got a hit.

https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa), specifically Question 15, emphasis my own:

> JorRaptor on UCP: « Do we need the Ubisoft launcher if we buy the game on Steam? »

> Ubisoft Connect Team: **Launching the game through Steam doesn't require you to download and install the Ubisoft Connect Launcher, as the Steam installation already includes a lite embedded version of it. You simply need to link your Ubisoft Connect account to Steam.**

> As Assassin's Creed Shadows comes with cross-save and cross-progression features, linking your Ubisoft Connect account allows us to provide you with a seamless experience no matter where you play. Through Ubisoft Connect, you will also be part of our global loyalty program to unlock rewards and exclusive discounts, including on pre-orders and new releases.

> For those without a Ubisoft Connect account, you can easily create one on the first launch and link it with your Steam account. This one-time setup ensures you won't need to log in again.

It will still require a Ubisoft *account,* and will require linking that account to your Steam account, but it will still boot directly into the game. It is an in-game login as opposed to a launcher.

"beefcat_","2025-03-21","I'm one of those 1 million players, I spent several hours with it last night. Here are my quick impressions.

First, the quality of the PC port. I think it's pretty exceptional and one of the best from a AAA publisher in a while.

1. Performance is rock solid. I run it with *all* settings maxed at *native* 1440p on a 4080, no need for upscaling or frame gen, and I'm getting 50-60+ FPS.
2. No sign of shader compilation or traversal stutters. It's a remarkably fluid experience, especially compared to most other AAA games coming out lately.
3. Great suite of PC centric features that all seem to work as expected. Uncapped framerate option that works, framerate cap options that don't introduce frame pacing issues, ultrawide support.
4. Only knock I have here is in-engine cutscenes always being capped at 30 FPS. And you notice it, because the first few hours of the game have *a lot* of them.

As for the game itself. I'll be comparing it to Odyssey since that is the last one I played.

1. It's Assassin's Creed. If you don't like the franchise, this game doesn't do anything to change your mind.
2. The combat system feels a lot more polished than prior entries. It feels very good to play. I need more time with it to be able to say more than that, but it doesn't have any immediate obvious problems that stick out to me.
3. The contrast between Naoe and Yasuke is bold and pretty entertaining. Combat as Yasuke in particular is goofy fun because, as a big tough black guy, he *towers* over everyone else in feudal Japan. His combat style leans into this, and fights in cramped spaces make you feel like a bull in a china shop. I see myself switching between these two characters pretty regularly.
4. The stealth feels significantly improved, especially playing on hard. As Naoe, you have a lot more options for playing stealthy than you did in Odyssey or Origins. Naoe being able to go prone is a neat addition that is hardly revolutionary, but significantly changes how areas are designed and look; there is a lot less conveniently chest high grass.
5. The open world is a lot more condensed and vertical than Odyssey. This is a big improvement for me. I've always been more partial to AC games set in dense cities like Rome or Paris.

EDIT: grammar is hard","1284","comment"

Really, a main menu of this kind is something characteristic of the Assassin's Creed series. That slowly emerging insignia and the background music—both of these things made you not even want to start the game, ugh the vibes were simply unmatched. A few months ago, another redditor (u/Zahhibb) created a fan concept of such a menu for AC: Shadows

>Expansive, detailed and polished, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a fantastic exploration and stealth game with beautiful Japanese aesthetics, somewhat diminished by a thin story, clumsy narrative, and immersion-breaking design choices. Despite this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable entry into the series for fans seeking to explore medieval Japan.

>I have experienced quite a few really cool moments while playing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but after 40 hours of playtime all those moments are lost in time like tears in rain. This new Creed has some interesting ideas to shake up the formula, but none of them are good enough to make it count. All in all, any potential for greatness was squandered for yet another opportunity to make a very big game.

>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a spectacular return to form for the franchise, delivering one of the series' more tightly focused historical adventures. *Shadows* is both the most tightly-paced and consistently rewarding entry in the modern *Assassin's Creed* games, delivering a version of Ubisoft's open-world gameplay that regularly fires on all cylinders in terms of its visual spectacle, historical tourism, meaningful side activities, satisfying combat, and compelling plot that drives the player forward.

>Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of two protagonists. And yes, for longer-term Assassin's Creed fans, there are a couple of moments that will excite those with a wider knowledge of the lore. But in general, Shadows is more standalone than perhaps any other game in the franchise to date, its focus fully on Japan, and free of any continuing characters or modern day storylines. That said, there's definitely space left for the future - within Shadows itself through more stories, or perhaps in another game entirely. Before the end credits roll, each character's story is rounded out but also given a tease of what's next, too.

>Despite some repetition and bloat that makes Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ final stretch drag more than the rest of the game excites, its brave approach to exploration in a gorgeous world, heartfelt personal stories, and satisfying tweaks to the formula still make it stand as one of my favourite entries yet. While no one can say if Shadows will be the all-timer hit that both Ubisoft and the series need right now, I can at least say that it’s more than worthy of your time.

>*Assassin’s Creed Shadows* doesn’t completely revolutionize the core of the franchise. You still climb towers, take out targets, sneak around places, and interact with real history. However, it does shake up everything around these cores. Now you might climb a tower during winter and see a whole different view than you did in summer. Now you can sneak in the shadows as a lithe assassin or kick down the door as a samurai tank.

"marcin18215","2025-05-16","[After 70 hours in Shadows, I'm really bored and tired of this game] Like with most games, I'm trying to complete the newest Assassin's Creed 100% discovering the whole map and doing all the missions. But after 70 hours, I'm so bored and tired of the gameplay that I don’t know if I can make it to the end. I’ve been a huge fan of the series since the first game, and I was really looking forward to *Shadows*, despite all the criticism. I didn’t care about the skin color of the main character or anything like that, I just wanted to have fun.

But after finishing the prologue, which in my opinion is still the best part of the game we basically do the same thing over and over again. Around 90% of the side missions are just: kill 100 bandits, find 10 flags, or worse another list of random targets to kill, with no deeper story behind it. You just enter a new province, talk to a villager who says a group of samurai is bothering him, and you get a list of 8 people to kill. That’s how most of the game goes. The amount of this kind of content is really overwhelming.

The main story isn’t that exciting either. It’s mostly about taking out more and more targets. Most of the main missions go like this: go find someone and talk, sneak into a fortress and kill a target. Killing the main targets doesn’t really affect the game world if you take out one, it doesn’t make the others hide or try to get revenge. There’s no real connection between the targets, they just feel like names on a checklist.

I really miss the more linear storylines, where every mission pushed the plot forward, had consequences in the world, and helped develop the main character. Here, it doesn’t feel like that.

Exploration is also pretty weak in my opinion. Most of the map feels empty. Besides villages, towns, and main roads, there’s not much to see. It’s just empty hills and forests. (By the way, it’s super annoying how the character keeps slipping when I try to climb small hills.) If you want to explore the whole map, it’s honestly exhausting.","1001","post"

"___LowKey___","2025-03-21","[The complains about AC Shadows stealth being ""easy"" are incredibly ironic] I've seen quite a lot of people on social media complaining that the stealth in Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't difficult enough and i'm sorry but the irony is just incredible.

Do you all remember how litteraly just months ago UbiSoft had to patch the whole of Star Wars Outlaws to remove forced stealth section and make stealth in general less important because everyone was whining that it was ""too hard"" and that ""stealth is a boring mechanic"", blah, blah, blah...?

Gamers constantly complain about stealth being in the way of ""the fun"", they constantly joke about how they always get caught anyway and have to go guns blazing so stealth is pointless... Y'all killed stealth in videogames and now cry that it's dead... please, shut up, you did that, now own it. No AAA will ever make stealth hard again, it's over, you got what you wanted, don't you dare complain about it.

"Nubian_Cavalry","2025-05-17","[Insomniac Games is an Amazing developer… Spider-Man 2 is half of an Amazing game. It’s opened my eyes to how corporations sabotage the artistry of their own products for profit] I thought about complaining about some of the story’s problems,  inconsistencies, how toothless the aesthetic for game with fucking *Venom* was, the sauceless dialogue, nostalgia blinded comparisons to Spider-Man 1 and to a lesser extent Miles Morales. How the whole Mr. Negative situation felt darker an edgier than ***VENOM*** of all things…

I also thought of “Twice the Spider-Men, half the game” as a title but I realized all of that would put the blame squarely on the developers. It’d devolve into a rant.

I’ll start with this: I was very distraught 
 in 2016 when a PlayStation exclusive Spider-Man game was announced. I will still in high school, and definitely couldn’t afford to hanker my hard working parents to get an extra console. I already have an Xbox. That level of entitlement would just be cruel and worthless, so I resigned to never touching it. But out of the kindness of their hearts, they got a PS4 slim for Christmas, 2018. My younger brother played it first, but never finished it. I Played it, 100%ed it, booted up Horizon Zero Dawn but played SM1 immediately during that, felt so much more enjoyable. (But I did end up liking HZD too.)

A similar issue with Miles Morales, but less severe. Despite this my parents, yet again, were kind enough to buy a $1.5k PS5 off a scalper for me (And by brother) to have it, and he played it first again. He finished it because we’re ninjas, he loves Miles. 👌🏿

(**Edit**: I already had a PS4. But I simply wanted to play on a next gen console, I was willing to wait until I could afford it but my brother's kind of entitled and demanded it that very instant from them.)

Both times, circumstances had me wait until 3-4 months after release. 

I replayed both games once more in anticipation for Spider-Man 2, even down to keeping track of the lore for each game. Hungry for how they’ll cap it all off in SM2. 5 months after revisiting both games, When SM2 came out, I voluntarily waited 4 additional months before touching it to wait for its bugs to iron out. In natural fashion, by younger brother got his hands on it first. He got halfway…

I did, truly enjoy the game. The gameplay improvements and combat improvements were superb. I loved the aesthetic of it, while not perfect, it was fresh and felt genuine. My first gripe was that upon acquiring the symbiote, i noticed the game was half done according to the mission section. 16/31. I’m thinking if they wanted the friendly neighborhood prologue, how are they going to do the black suit arc *and* the venom arc justice?

They… did it. That much is for sure. I did love the vibe you get playing black suit Peter, but it felt rushed.

I said I wouldn’t complain about the stories issues but, seriously. It barely had enough breathing room to say and do everything it wanted to. Down to the point where in the conclusion, characters are talking about things that didn’t even happen in the plot.

Down to the point where Peter and Miles are jumping on top of Venom, and this weird camera clicking and flickering happens and he just punts them away or runs off. Or especially the first time we see him the camera smooths into itself as if we’re about to fight him, then it fakes out with >!Norman running in shouting “Don’t hurt Harry!”!< just laughed outloud when that happened.

It felt so incredibly obvious to me that the game had cut content. Cut content that was ready to go but couldn’t because they were being rushed. 

I forgot to mention that I (Obviously) heard of the insomniac leaks. Read into it a bit and saw a lot. Insomniac was rushed. The game was meant to be much, much longer and I felt this would have alleviated many of the plot problems by giving each plot point more time to breath. They say they were being rushed, and were forced to stitch together the last act of the game with what they had closest to completion in a way that made narrative sense. It wasn’t finished

I felt everyone was being negative, tried to gaslight myself into ignoring it. But alas, their fears proved correct.

This is the ultimate flaw with spider-man 2. It’s not at its best. I’m not saying “Oh maybe if they revamped this section” or “The plot should have been different!” I’m saying what they settled for, compromised for, and were set to release didn’t even come out.

I have my issues with Horizon Forbidden West and God of War Ragnarok, but they did not feel rushed. The plots and gameplay could have been better, but they were polished to completion. It said and did everything it was meant to say and do which is why I recall these games more fondly. Despite their problems. Everything that was cut from the game appears to have been cut earlier in development and they were allowed to have their side stories and such. Their slow moments.

I also have guaranteed assassination turned on and just decided to fight a target and realized I've been missing out on a lot of dialogue by just assassinating them.

Both of these problems could be solved by them having the after death confessions that the game used to have and it made me realize just how much I miss them.  They were such an effective way to make sure we knew exactly what they had done and show us the true nature of the person we killed.","824","post"
"nazcatraz","2025-03-23","[Shadows in the best AC game I’ve played since Black Flag] I’ve played every single Assassin’s Creed game on release day and have been disappointed with every release since Syndicate. That was the point where it felt like they were running out of ideas. Origins was alright, but it felt like they were experimenting with a new formula.

Odyssey and Valhalla? We weren’t even playing as an assassin in those games. And the RPG stuff got so annoying. Mirage? Just a side game that felt like DLC. I got bored with it real fast. Missed oppurtunity tbh consider how cool the settings of that game is (closest we got to AC1).

Shadows is actually great when it comes to balancing the RPG stuff with classic AC gameplay. Guaranteed assassinations are back, and exploration with the scouts is actually dope. You actually get to play as an assassin this time. Naoe feels like a ninja killing machine. The combat feels smooth, unlike the MMO-style clunkiness of the last 4 games (looking at you too Mirage).

Stealth as Naoe is AMAZING. Makes me feel like I’m playing Tenchu. Playing as Yasuke feel like playing as a boss. Dude is a TANK!! IMO I’m glad they went with him as one of the main character because how many time will we keep having a generic Japanese guy as the protagonist after so many games being set in Japan in recent years. If you don’t like this idea I could totally understand why, but that’s just my opinion. 

This is the first time since Black Flag that an AC game has brought me so much joy. I’m so happy with how this game turned out and cannot wait for Hexe. Honestly, I’m having more fun playing this than Ghost of Tsushima and Rise of the Ronin, since I really hate the rock-paper-scissors combat that forces players into specific stances of those 2 games. 

Assassin’s Creed is officially back on the menu for me!","823","post"

"oaleebih","2025-03-20","[They called Ghost of Tsushima a copy of Assassin's Creed, and now they're saying the opposite] When the trailer for Ghost of Tsushima was first released, many immediately compared it to Assassin's Creed. I remember when the gameplay trailer dropped—people were quick to judge, saying this is just Assassin’s Creed in Japan, the one we’ve always wanted. They claimed the gameplay was copied, the stealth mechanics were the same, and that it was just another Assassin’s Creed but with samurai.

But then, when the game actually came out, people stopped talking and just played. And what happened? They enjoyed it. They were captivated by the world, mesmerized by the graphics, and drawn into the story. Over time, Ghost of Tsushima carved out its own identity and became a brand of its own.

On the other hand, Ubisoft released Odyssey, Valhalla, and Mirage, all of which received mixed reactions. The franchise had changed its core gameplay, moving away from what once defined it. Despite remaining one of the biggest names in the gaming industry, Assassin’s Creed slowly lost the value it once held, overshadowed by fan dissatisfaction and internal struggles.

Now, with Assassin’s Creed Shadows set in Japan, the narrative has flipped. Just because the game is set in Japan, people are calling it a Ghost of Tsushima copy. And it seems like this will happen to any game set in Japan moving forward. But that shouldn’t be a concern—for the very reasons I just mentioned.

If AC Shadows turns out to be a well-crafted game with a compelling story, the gaming community will embrace it. And Assassin’s Creed will reclaim its former glory.

Simply put, from an Assassin’s Creed fan since 2007—I have hope.","803","post"

"Ubi-AssassinsCreed","2025-04-30","[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Post launch Roadmap Update – A first look at what’s
coming next!] Hello Assassins,

It’s already been a month since the launch of AC Shadows! It’s been thrilling to see millions of you enjoying the game. But now, it’s time for us to look towards the future and reveal a little more about our post-launch plans.



[WATCH A FULL BREAKDOWN OF WHATS TO COME HERE ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLB-WNvQEQ)



Beyond the usual stability and balancing updates, we plan on dropping free updates on the regular with the goal of continually enrich the experience. Along with the ever-changing Animus content, you can expect new immersion customization options, new difficulty settings, new modes, the highly requested New Game+, free quests showcasing fan-favorite characters, a few very special collaborations, and we are at hard at work on community driven improvements.

https://preview.redd.it/z9iokzha40ye1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b2a958c8ce33d2610fc00abe1e7eba2df5a327

1. New Ally, abilities, activities, and additional backstory that will permanently impact the game
2. Optional paid content
3. Free if pre-ordered the game Commented

# CLAWS OF AWAJI

First and foremost, we have our first expansion - the Claws of Awaji - coming later this year. Free to all players who pre-ordered AC Shadows, this expansion opens up the island of Awaji – a brand-new region for you to explore which continues Naoe and Yasuke’s story right after the end of Shadows’ epilogue. You can expect new enemies, new abilities for both characters, and a new weapon specific to Naoe – the Bo staff. Stay tuned as we reveal more! Until then, let's have a look at what else you can expect!

# NEW STORY DROPS

The coming months of post-launch will also include multiple free content additions we're calling **Story Drops**. These new free quests will introduce new player abilities, new allies, new world activities, and provide deeper looks and backstories for some of your favorite characters, each new piece of content expanding on the main game. Our first story drop will be part of the Early May update and is called “The Works of Luis Frois”: it will give you a deeper look at the titular historical Jesuit scholar who’s work about the Sengoku period of Japan endures to this day.

# PARKOUR UPDATES

For all you deep parkour enthusiasts, we’ll be adding new parkour interactions and optimization, with the first update coming later in May. In this first update, we’ll be adding the often-requested **height-gaining back-ejects**, fully re-animated **height-gaining side-ejects**, and a brand-new parkour move called the **Vertical Ledge Jump**, allowing both characters to jump and grab onto awnings and lower overhangs – a move that is particularly handy when wall-runs are not an option. We’ll be adding more little parkour tricks and improvements over the course of the year as we perfect them to keep you on your toes!

# PHOTO MODE UPDATE

Alongside Parkour, we’re expanding the Photo Mode with new filters and stickers, new character poses and facial expressions, and even adding ambient music for you to enjoy. All targeted at giving you more options and comfort when it comes to capturing the beauty of Feudal Japan.

# COMMUNITY FEEDBACK UPDATES

Community feedback has been a core focus of the team throughout development and that’s not stopping now that Shadows is released. On April 8, we have deployed our first major patch, which has fixed a number of bugs and brought numerous quality-of-life improvements, such as **Horse-auto follow**, urban **speed improvements**, single **mastery nodes reset**, and **multi-item selection** at merchants and at your forge. See the full patch notes here: [AC Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 - Release Notes.](https://www.ubisoft.com/fr-ca/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej/ac-shadows-title-update-102-release-notes)

We’ll be dropping our second Community Feedback Update in June, which will allow you to **toggle your Head Gear** on during dialogues and cutscenes, as well as customize your immersion further: you’ll be free to disable individual visual effects such as **weapon glints** during combat, black-and-white (and red) **ability filters**, target **assassination celebration effects**, and disabling **stealth outlines** when your characters is vanished. We are also expanding the Alarm System and are bringing it to the Open-World to give you even more challenge!

# MORE TO COME ON THE REGULAR

Future updates will bring more **free Animus Hub** content, a pretty fleshed-out **New Game +** **mode**, which will also raise the level cap, and for those of you looking for a challenge, we are hard at work on an even **tougher difficulty setting** for both combat and stealth that should leave none of you unscathed…

>Bloober Team continues their mastery of atmosphere with Cronos: The New Dawn. While its story draws you in with fear and brutality, repetitive level design and combat prevent it from maintaining the same quality.

>Cronos: The New Dawn is one of the most complete, creative, and thrilling games of this year, and without a doubt, one of the best horror games of this generation. It hasn’t come just to announce its presence; it’s here to push the genre forward, add new elements to it, and prove that there’s still room for creativity and fresh ideas in survival horror.

>Cronos: The New Dawn seems like the hidden successor to the Dead Space Trilogy that takes us back to its roots. The game offers incredible sound design and a terrifying atmosphere. The amazing graphics come with some fps drops, even in Performance Mode in the PS5. Melee is sadly a joke if you run out of bullets, but the great weapon design makes up for it. The story is also well done with the right amount of scares.

>Cronos: The New Dawn is a strong new scary entry from Bloober Team, mixing well-worn tropes of the genre with some interesting sci-fi twists and a captivating, if somewhat confusing, narrative tying it all together. Balancing a restricted inventory while tackling waves of disgusting creatures makes for an intense time, and exploring the infected district in Poland is a memorable setting. Cronos: The New Dawn is confident in delivering what it set out to do; it's a new survival horror IP that has legs – and lots of other limbs – carrying it to spooky success.

>Cronos: The New Dawn is a culmination of over a decade of experience from Bloober Team. Through the years, the studio has risen to the challenge, and this trend continues with its newest franchise, which is a mix of some of the biggest survival horror games to exist. The campaign is brutal and challenges you to survive in a bleak, failed world where a virus has wreaked havoc in Eastern Europe, and the sci-fi elements present a fun twist on the formula.

"ImmortalThunderGod79","2025-04-04","[[Potential Spoilers] As a Japanese history enthusiast, I am very pleased with how Oda Nobunaga was represented in AC Shadows] Some AC fans might remember that I made a post last year [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cx5mo8/historical_analysis_of_oda_nobunaga_japans_first/) (if you have not read it yet) about the First Great Unifier of Japan himself - even discussing my hopes and fears on how I would like to see Oda Nobunaga be represented in the game with the AC fandom which there were very wonderful insightful conversations... Finding the right balance between artistic creative liberties and faithfulness to history. Half of them ended becoming true as speculated on. 

Needless to say as someone who had Nobunaga as one of my favorite Japanese historical figures ever to study and learn about. AC Shadows in my opinion did right by him - even despite his limited screen time. He was cunning, ambitious and charismatic, had just the right amount of commanding presence, ruthlessness and compassion - he's a man who is human and flawed like us, but ultimately someone who wishes to do everything necessary to bring back peace and stability to Japan after it was torn apart by decades of civil war and political strife in the Sengoku Jidai. In addition the scenes of his friendship with Yasuke I found to be really touching plus the fact that he continued to have a constant presence in how he changed Yasuke's life for the better and Yasuke outright hunting the people who were responsible for his master's death.... Very close to how Nobunaga was depicted in real history and historical documents we have of him while still giving the unique AC spin on him. 

Which was VERY refreshing to me seeing a depiction of Nobunaga who is flawed, but human rather then a cartoonishly evil villain like some media depictions - AC Shadows might be up there as some of my favorite video game depictions of the man himself other then the Samurai Warriors and Nioh games. 

So all in all I am very happy with how Nobunaga was represented in this game overall as a Japanese history lover, but I am curious - how do other AC fans here feel about Oda Nobunaga's depiction and characterization in Shadows?...","747","post"

With stunning visuals, fluid gameplay, and a deeply immersive world, Assassin’s Creed Shadows stands tall as one of the best entries in the series. This is the Most Beautiful Assassin's Creed Game Ever!

>With some truly wonderful writing and an engaging pair of protagonists, I adored Assassin’s Creed Shadows. I was obsessed with finishing the assassination targets and working through the Objective board with many late nights to see it through. The wait for Ubisoft to bring the series to Japan has been worth it, especially given the technical appeal of modern gaming making it even more impressive than I had imagined. Naoe and Yasuke are my definitive heroes for this series, two individuals who are wonderfully portrayed by their respective actors, and the talented team that brought them to life.

>Assassin's Creed Shadows has taken a long-overdue step forward with its new mechanics and technical improvements. You'll just have to overlook the mediocre writing and a narrative that lacks pacing.

>If you've always dreamed of exploring Feudal Japan as a stealthy assassin, Shadows is the game for you. It stands out as one of Ubisoft's best efforts in blending history with fiction, while there's still work to be done to fully restore the series to its former glory, Shadows is undoubtedly a significant step in the right direction.

>It’s a well-crafted game within its own scale with a great story and emotionally resonant characters, but in the grand scheme of what a big open-world RPG could provide, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t maximize its potential.

>AC Shadows isn’t revolutionizing its franchise or its genre, but it’s overall going to be a good time for those who seek it out. This is a more-than-worthy entry in the franchise, and overall, those who most enjoyed Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla will get the most out of Shadows, considering they're the most similar in scale and overall gameplay structure.

"SapporoBiru","2025-03-28","[I wish the open world in AC games felt less like an open air museum] So after having played Shadows for a week now, I have to say that my initial excitement has died down a fair bit and I already start feeling a bit burned out. As with Origins and Odyssey, they once again crafted an absolutely stunning open world with a ton of detail. But just as with these games, it feels more like am walking around a theme park without actually interacting with it. 
The function to get some historical context every now and then is great in theory but doesn't help the feeling like I am in a museum. When discovering a new town, I can talk to maybe 3 people and one or two merchants. Oh, and pet dogs. 

A big issue for me is also how very little unique some important places work as part of the level design. Osaka castle should historically speaking be a super important landmark in the game. Yet I can just walk in there within the first couple of hours and kill everyone without having to worry too much about the layout of the castle etc. And the process of infiltrating castles stays the exact same for every single one of them. Except for nice vistas, the rewards for exploration are also quite negligible since equipment gets outscaled so quickly.

I just wish they would include at least a little bit more immersion. I don't expect KC2, but just some elements to make the world feel alive. At least that would help me not feeling burned out by the game after such a short while.","674","post"

>The First Berserker: Khazan is a more than promising title for fans of Nioh, Sekiro or Dark Souls. The fast-paced battles, dark setting and mechanics such as the bonus Lacrima system provide a fresh touch to the genre. The chic cel-shaded look and the motivating revenge story also provide the necessary reason to slay enemies and bosses.

However, some frustrating boss mechanics, braindead AI, and puzzling mission structure hold it back from reaching its full potential.

>The First Berserker: Khazan is a brilliant blend of the Soulslike and Hack and Slash genres, offering some of the best combat in recent gaming years and an incredibly polished product. While it does have some shortcomings in its story, replayability, and occasionally borrows too heavily from past titles, if you live for action games such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice or Devil May Cry 5, this game will likely be your Game of the Year so far and a title we can recommend at full price.

>The First Berserker: Khazan is the best Soulslike I've played since Lies of P. The game can sometimes overstay its welcome, but the excellent combat, boss fights, and stellar presentation more than makeup for that. If you're hungry for a new hardcore action RPG, Khazan is the game to pick up.

"TehRealSpodermen","2025-04-17","[The towns in AC Shadows feel eerily silent] Currently 40 hours in, and I've been enjoying shadows a lot, but one glaring thing for me that seems like a missed opportunity is the ambient noise. Walking or riding through towns is silent which doesn't make sense when you see the amount of NPCs doing different activities. I can't help but think of Like a Dragon Ishin which while being one of my least favourite Yakuza/like a dragon games always had the sounds of NPCs chatting/calling you out/bringing you to their shop. In contrast, everywhere in shadows kinda feels like a ghost town which is a shame because I feel like it's a small thing that would add so much to the immersion. Anyone else feel the same or am I nitpicking at a minor thing?","583","post"

I'm not necessarily complaining, I like them and am playing Shadows too, but god damn I dream of a day Ubisoft can actually take a step forward in their games and make something that feels special and that I would actually tell people to play.","574","comment"
"Ermid123","2025-04-26","[Assassin's Creed was always supposed to be easy.] A lot of people have complained about Ubisoft having boring and easy combat. I disagree. While I think it's easy, it's not boring. I'm a Huge Souls fan. I've beaten a lot of bosses, overcame many challenges and loved the brutally difficult combat. But that's not why I got into Assassin's Creed. In fact, I really enjoy AC3 and AC4 type of animation based combat, even though it is incredibly easy.

I think this also participated in ruining AC Combat. People complained about this and then Ubisoft shifted to RPG, which they didn't succeed. Origins was good but Odyssey was so spongy It felt like I was hitting enemies with a plastic knife.

Valhalla looks so bad I don't even want to waste money in that, maybe when I get a PS Plus and Mirage - just Awful Combat.

Now to be fair, the easy combat system wasn't great all the time either. AC2 in my personal and subjective opinion (I'm gonna get hate for this I know), rivals Syndicate and Mirage for having the worst combat in the franchise. But mostly, old AC combat was significantly better than the newer ones.

Shadows Combat looks really good though, I'll probably play the game this summer and then judge it myself.","559","post"

While Japan is embroiled in internal power struggles, the Templars seize the opportunity to extend their control. Naoe and Yasuke oppose oppression, not just as assassins and samurai, but as warriors of a greater ideal. In the end, it's not where they come from, but what they fight for that counts.""

We had [63 roundup posts in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/10kh10z/meta_the_roundup_of_rpatientgamers_2022_roundups/) and [57 in 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/198wyki/meta_the_roundup_of_rpatientgamers_2023_roundups/), so we figured we'd get somewhere in that same ballpark. And sure enough, when we look at the number of roundup posts this year, oh no we've made a terrible mistake.

We've got **150 roundup posts** catalogued for 2024, and while I know the subreddit has grown substantially over time, that's a ludicrous number, right? It's frankly so ludicrous as to be completely untenable going forward: if this exercise is to continue into 2025 and beyond we're going to have to make major changes to how we handle everything. More on that as December arrives, I suppose, but suffice it to say this holiday season was something of a moderation ordeal, and that's not even considering the data parsing happening below. Was it all worthwhile? Let's find out!

"hkf999","2025-04-02","It's subtle, but really smart to introduce the killable servants in forts. I don't think the series has ever done that. The people who get the prompt to assassinate have always been enemies or at least soldiers. Armed people who would attack you on sight unless you kill them first. Instead, the servants in Shadows run away from you on sight. They don't pose a threat to you, except they could alert actual enemies. Still, you can kill them in cold blood. You even get xp from it. The game doesn't discourage it at all, it actively awards you for it.

Still... it does feel a bit bad, doesn't it?","529","comment"
"allmistakes","2025-03-27","[AC Shadows is a strong 8/10 for me] I’ve been reading this sub and seeing mostly positive comments, but then I looked at some review sites and was shocked by how harsh some of the users scores were.

Let’s be real: Assassin’s Creed was never a Game of the Year contender (maybe back in the AC II days when the competition was thinner). But here’s my honest, spoiler-free opinion based on my time with the game:

---

Story – 7/10
Way more grounded than Valhalla or Odyssey. It reminded me a bit of Origins and even some older AC titles. The revenge plot isn’t revolutionary, but the way the story is structured feels fresh.
No hard line between “main” and “side” content - it all blends in naturally, which makes the world feel real. Contracts are still obviously XP farming, but hey, we’ve all been there and it makes microtransactions not needed.
(I know Ubisoft tends to be greedy but for me, the in-game store isn’t ruining the experience unless you’re really looking for reasons to hate it.)

---

Graphics – 9.5/10
Absolutely feels next-gen. Not quite as detailed as top-tier linear games, but shockingly close. The seasons, physics, and traversal all work together beautifully.
Docking half a point only because every time I play a new AC game, I think it looks like this, then I go back and realize how far we've come.

---

Combat – 7.5/10
I’m not a Souls guy, mostly because I’m bad at them. But this combat system feels solid and challenging.
Still some annoying AC issues (getting spotted in bushes, inputs not registering), and I’ve died more here than in any AC before, but honestly, I’m into it. It’s creative, and stealth is finally taken seriously.
That said, I’m not a big fan of going back to Yasuke - it brings back the Valhalla vibes I was happy to move past.

---

Characters – 8/10
I genuinely like both protagonists. Their stories are compelling and they feel distinct, not just in gameplay, but in personality and tone.
I spent about 70-75% of the time playing as Naoe, mostly because her stealth-focused approach felt more like classic AC. But Yasuke has serious flair, and I enjoyed every second with him. They balance each other really well.

Systems – 8.5/10
Ubisoft’s strength has always been systems. Nothing mind-blowing here, but everything works well.
The skill tree actually pushes me to explore, and the homestead stuff is a nice touch. It all feels familiar but polished.

Final Thoughts
For me, this is the best RPG-style AC yet. It’s fun, immersive, detailed, and polished.
Maybe I’m just an AC fan who doesn’t care much for historical nitpicking, but I’m genuinely enjoying the hell out of it.

It’s still a Ubisoft game, it’s still Assassin’s Creed, but if this had been the first game in the series, I honestly think it would’ve been a Game of the Year contender.
It’s not perfect, but it’s the most refined version of AC to date, and it absolutely shows.","527","post"
"Amunds3n","2025-03-20","[2 hours in, I'm already loving AC Shadows!] I have not seen this much character depth since AC2! The soundtrack is kicking massive ass, and I love the enhanced stealth difficullty. It's really refreshing to get away from the birds eye view recon of the past few games, as it always took me a bit out of it. Like how would I know what a bird is seeing, right?

Stealth so far feels more like Metal Gear than anything else. Just being able to prone has been so profoundly revitalizing for the stealth. I feel like I don't want to go back to losing that level of flexibility with the stealth.

The facial expressions and character animation feels fantastic. The best since AC2 imo. And while obviously graphically Shadows blows AC2 out of the water, what I mean is the characters have been animated and written to be so believable in how they speak, move, and react to each other.

I have no idea if Ubisoft is gonna shit the bed and tank long term, or if we never see another AC game. I hope this won't be their last, but I am really very thankful to see a strong showing out of Shadows. I've wanted an AC game set in Japan since 5 minutes into playing AC1, so this is really hitting that Tenchu itch for me.

Hope you guys are enjoying the journey too! Make sure you send that sick-day email ASAP, we got better things to do than go in to work today lol.","524","post"

# PATCH SIZES:  

PS5: \~3.31 GB  

XBS: \~19 GB  

MAC: \~9 GB  

PC: \~13 GB  

Steam: \~4.3 GB 

# PATCH HIGHLIGHTS  

**“Thrown to the Dogs” Quest Unlocked** 

With this update, all players will receive access to the pre-order bonus quest, “Thrown to the Dogs”. Help a loyal dog avenge his late master and unlock Tsuki-maru as a pet to place in your Hideout.   

The quest is available in early game, once you have completed “From Spark to Flame”. It can be found at the Tennoji Temple, outside of Osaka

# SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS   

**Dead By Daylight Event** 

We're excited to unveil our first special collaboration with this new Dead by Daylight event coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows.   

As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat...  

This event comes with a new free quest that you can access from the Hideout upon unlocking Yasuke as a playable character. Once the event is completed, you will obtain a free trinket and banner.   

You will also be able to further personalize your two characters with a Dead by Daylight-inspired pack in the store, featuring outfits, weapons, trinkets, and the chance to ride off into the shadows with none other than the loyal steed, Maurice.

**Balatro Trinket**  

We are also adding a new trinket for Naoe, and an amulet for Yasuke called ""Winning Hand"" -- directly inspired by Balatro. These new items come with a legendary perk that gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders.  

Now... you will need to work together to figure out how to get it!  

  

# PARKOUR IMPROVEMENTS  

The team has prepared a bunch of improvements to enhance the parkour mechanics. We want to give a big thank you to all our dedicated parkour players for their ongoing feedback since launch.   

Here are the main changes:   

**Sprint Toggle Lock**

As long as the directional inputs are maintained, sprint no longer disengages when using Parkour Up or Parkour Down.  

**New Vertical Jump**  

We're adding a brand-new parkour interaction allowing both Naoe and Yasuke to jump and grab any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall-runs. To trigger it, simply press the jump button as you approach low overhangs, and your character will make the jump.

**Enhanced Back and Side Ejects**  

We've also enhanced the distance and height of side & back ejects, favoring foot landings over hand landings. This includes new animations for Naoe when performing height-gaining side ejects, extending her capacity to remain high-up during parkour.   

https://preview.redd.it/b3dm5659953f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33e2fc3f46d46494aaa5cbaeea3f0db0f776ced8

1: The wandering merchant guy from Far Cry. I'm fairly sure that we were supposed to be able to stop this guy to buy rations and ammo.

2: The 'gamefied' shop signs make me think that all of them were supposed to work and be interactive, including the stables.

3: Same deal with the 'gamefied' banners for castles, forts and camps. I think there was supposed to be some sort of faction or allegiance system. When you change season the UI popup even states that factions have been reset.

4: Naoe being able to get up (change stance) on horseback but I've yet to initiate an attack or assassination while doing it.

Any others? Remember, I 'm not talking about missing features per se (there's way too many) but more about missing features that there's evidence that they were intended to be in the game but ended up on the cutting room floor.","492","post"

"Ermid123","2025-07-05","[We Can't have every single historical setting in Assassin's Creed] Over the years, The Parkour in Assassin's Creed has been severely downgraded. We like to criticize Ubisoft for that but what If I told you, it's actually our fault too, because we were the ones who demanded Ancient Egypt, Greece and Japan.

I don't remember who he really was, but I know that somebody who worked on Assassin's Creed once said ""Egypt, Japan and WW1 would be worst settings for AC"". Well, he wasn't lying.

Isn't it strange that AC Shadows gets every gameplay pillar right except for parkour? Combat is fun and enjoyable, Stealth is, in my opinion, one of the best in the series, world is stunning and exploration is decent. But Parkour, Shallow and Boring.
A lot of people say Unity was the pinnacle of Parkour. While that can be true, you can't just Paste Unity's Parkour into a world with wide streets and call it a day. Syndicate and Unity Parkour Systems are exactly the same, but Unity finds itself at the top, Syndicate at the bottom. The problem lies in the world design. One has narrow streets, another has wide.

Settings like Egypt and Japan do not support Parkour very well. They are interesting to explore, but terrible when you judge them as an AC Game Open World.

Then there's another aspect, The Odyssey Thing. Some people just like to explore ancient Worlds, very ancient, the time when The Hidden Ones weren't even formed. 

I even saw one guy who said Ancient Sumer/Mesopotamia would be a great AC Setting. That is just nonsense imo:
1.Basically No Parkour, the game would become Ghost of Tsushima where there are a lot of empty environments and only 5 small buildings per settlement.
2.The Hidden Ones weren't formed, it would be just another Odyssey, just another IP Milking.","474","post"
"ManonManegeDore","2025-03-22","It's the worst, most manufactured outrage I've seen for a game since The Last of Us Part II. Nothing will ever top that because people had deluded themselves into thinking the game was not only bad, but the worst game ever made. That was a very common take. 


But yes, both suffered from terminally online right wing grifters actively lying about the game and people just agreeing because they want the game to fail. That's why people, in all these AC Shadows related threads, are spouting literal lies and conspiracy theories and people are uncritically accepting them as fact. 


> Also, it was a little funny when you realize these same people were now advocating for the tired (and debunked) argument that “video games cause real world violence” now made by the Japanese politicians.


It's honestly insane how quickly this subreddit switched up on this issue when Japanese politicians started complaining.

I have a lot of stuff to do today but I legit couldn't put it down. 

The intro is basically a 2 hour movie. The tone is way more serious than Valhalla. The immersion option has everyone speaking in their native language with subtitles. 

The graphics look incredible. The combat was satisfying once I got the rhythm down. Stealth actually feels like stealth and I'm glad they brought the splinter cell darkness mechanic back. I'd recommend expert mode as well. It's much better when enemies actually look up.

"Queasy_Pop8292","2025-04-02","[Shadows shows that Ubisoft is learning] Wether you like the game or not

Here’s a list of innovations in shadows that address previous criticisms:

-guaranteed assassinations being an option 
-movement is more unique
-the grappling hook adds new movement tech
-bushes and grass can now be cut
-character driven and unique upgrade paths
-more focus on the content within the map than the size of it
-option for Japanese dub
-animus storyline moving forward 
-one combat heavy character and another stealth heavy character, allowing for proper immersion (you’re not some 6’10 brute with a heavy blunt weapon climbing a 2 story building to assassinate a target 
-weapon system is culturally unique
-Npc intelligence 
-dedicated up and down climbing buttons
-not taking up a trigger for movement
-throwing weapons have proper weight 
-dismemberment and proper gore
-fast weighted combat that properly represents Japan
-a second playable character that isn’t just you but the opposite gender
-zero time wasted on a long winded combatless intro

This is what I could come up with, I personally would prefer more freedom with the grappling hook, and not being able to climb most trees as a ninja is a massive miss.

Anyways let me know what else you think they have attempted to address in Shadows.

Edit: i’ve come to find that with assassin’s creed, you shouldn’t listen to individual reviews. Everyone seems to want a different thing from each game. Leading to a community full of bitching, moaning, while still majority buying. I hate Ubisoft too, but if all we do is either glaze a game as being perfect, or call it complete trash then nothing ever really changes. I enjoyed this game, it wasn’t my favorite assassin’s creed game, but I liked it more than Valhalla and odyssey. If you don’t see it as a step forward than frankly I don’t think you know what you want, and even if you do i’m absolutely positive you don’t have a profit friendly solution. So grow up and stop supporting the franchise or buy your slop, and play it little piglet.","446","post"
"KvasirTheOld","2025-03-20","[AC Shadows: play on Expert and Immersive mode (and a few other tips)] So I've played a bit of Shadows and I have some tips for you guys. These is how to make the game as enjoyable as possible!

1) play on Expert (mainly for stealth). Stealth in this game is heavily improved. In fact I'm willing to say that it's on par with unity and tied for best stealth in the series. But one important thing is to play on expert! Why? Because it adds a whole new layer of complexity to the game! Enemies now fave vertical Vision cones as well, meaning you don't reign supreme on the rooftops anymore! Yes guards will look up and they'll see you. A lot kore realistic and challenging!

2) Play on guided mode! This game's exploration mode is basically pointless. You're just wasting a good scout to reveal the exact location. On guided mode, the location is revealed to you. You're basically reducing your grind and Saving money and time by not having ti wait for seasons to change or replenish the scouts.

3) Immersive mode is the goat! Seriously I can't stress this enough. The Japanese voice acting is on par with games like Yakuza! It's way better than English. Do yourself a favor and trust me on this!

4) Explore! Knowledge points are the most important aspect of this game. The only way you can become stronger and get better and more fun skills! Plus you get amazing story beads for doing the meditation mini game

5) naoe is quick. Take advantage of that. She can easily take down a dozen enemies with only one smoke bomb. Just gather enemies in one place with a bell, throw a smoke then assassinate all of them.

6) the hideout is very important. You get a t9n of benefits! Engraving legendary perks, more xp, more scouts and so on.

This is about all i had to say. I hope this helps a bit and makes the game more fun for you!","446","post"

"Penitent_Ragdoll","2025-03-17","[Getting older as a gamer] I often see people talking about how they prefer easier, more streamlined games as they get older because they have other responsibilities and less time to play.

I have a rather different perspective that I'd like to share. I'm 35, working a 40-hour week, with a wife, children, and a house to manage, and my experience is almost the opposite of the common narrative.

Of course, my responsibilities mean I don't have as much time to game as I did when I was a teenager. However, I can now use my gaming time much more efficiently, deriving greater enjoyment and engaging with games on a much deeper level.

Here's why:

* I tend to play more demanding games than I used to. It's not just that I prefer higher difficulty settings, but I also gravitate toward more complex games in general.

* I have a deeper understanding of game design concepts, mechanics, and real-life knowledge, which enhances my gaming experience by providing more context.

* I'm better at analyzing and solving problems, as well as doing 'mental math.'

* I know what kinds of games I enjoy, so I don't waste time on titles I know won't interest me.

* Social pressure, trend-chasing, and FOMO no longer affect me, or at least they're greatly diminished. I don't feel the need to play ""The Next Big Thing"" just because everyone is talking about it. I also don't feel pressured to stay ahead of the curve to remain relevant in gaming circles.

When I was 16, I played **Dragon Age: Origins** and struggled even on the lowest difficulty. I finished the game, but it took me a long time. Recently, I replayed it, jumped straight into Nightmare mode, and breezed through it. If I had played **Disco Elysium** as a teen, I wouldn't have understood half of what the game was talking about, nor would I have had the patience to finish it. When I played **Age of Empires 2** back in the day, I mostly stuck to the campaign and experimented with the map editor. Now, I play competitively, climbing the ranked ladder and still enjoying the game 20 years later.

As a teenager, I would have been eager to jump on games like **MH: Wilds** or **AC: Shadows** the moment they launched. Nowadays, I don't feel that urgency because I know those games are only marginally aligned with my interests, and I can pick them up whenever I feel like it.

That said, this is just my perspective. I know a lot players who have shifted towards more casual games, and while I can see why are they playing these games, they are not that fulfilling to me. My idea of a relaxing game is **Factorio** or **Elden Ring**, theirs might be **Stardew Valley.** Their idea of thrilling, engaging game might be something like **Marvel Rivals**, for me it's **Planetscape Torment**.  

So - older gamers - what's your opinion on this topic?","424","post"
"Helgardh","2025-04-21","[Shadows fundamentally changed how I play AC games - exploration] I don't know why they did it, but Shadows' obsession with punishing exploration has made me approach the game more differently than any of the others. 

When I started the game I would be riding/running along, see a place and wonder ""I'd like to go there"". So I head off the path and within twenty metres I'm suddenly either in bushes so thick I can't see Naoe at all and am having to guess where I'm going, or I'm hitting a rock wall that Naoe refuses to use the grappling hook to climb, or she's run up against a slight incline that's miraculously impassible. She's so profoundly athletic but give her a slight incline that a toddler could manage and all of a sudden it's like she just discovered she has feet. 

I managed to get Settsu, Harima and Yamashiro 95%+ exposed, but since then I just cannot tolerate the games' approach to exploration, and all I'm willing to do is set a destination and have the horse auto run it. Ubisoft fully beat the idea of exploring this absolutely gorgeous map out of me and all it took were three regions.

"FriarKentuck","2025-04-21","[Assassin’s Creed’s meta-narrative was something special. Where’s it gone?] As someone who pre-ordered and played Assassin’s Creed at launch back in 2007, I was immediately impressed and intrigued with the franchise. Largely because despite having watched trailers and even behind the scenes interviews with the devs team, it was merely presented as a game set during the Third Crusade, but once I booted it up and realised we were in an ‘Animus’ as Desmond, the stakes were raised in a big way. 

Suddenly there was *more* going on. It was set in September 2012, a year that wasn’t of any significance to me at the time, but as the years progressed and all of the ‘Doomsday’ predictions based around the Mayan calendar for December 21st 2012 started to emerge, I was blown away by the deep cut level of meta-storytelling that had gone into this franchise.

Obviously the series’ direction shifted due to factors like the departure of Patrice Désilets and Ubisoft’s desire to release a new title annually (as opposed to the original trilogy that had been planned) and even with Ezio getting a trilogy, despite the abrupt ending to Desmond’s story in Assassin’s Creed III, at that stage in the series it had been so meticulously presented and cleverly executed that any follow up was always going to be a tall order.

But when Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag released and blew audiences away, even though the modern day story now felt weaker without Desmond, it was lauded as not only a great Assassin’s Creed game, but arguably the best ‘pirate game’ ever.

From this point going forward the franchise pivoted and shifted and even ‘rebooted’ in a sense with the release of Assassin’s Creed Origins, 10 years after the first game’s release.

Nowadays with the recent release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it’d be almost unrecognisable (besides the title) to someone who’d not played in the last 10 years. This I feel (and have seen many others here suggest similar) is why there is such a divide in the fanbase.

Now to the point of discussion (thanks for your patience if you made it this far): if you weren’t as fortunate as myself to start playing from the beginning *WHILE THE GAMES WERE BEING RELEASED* (the strength of the meta-narrative is sadly not repeatable playing those earlier games today for the first time) and started from a later point in the franchise, do you feel you’ve given yourself enough context to fully enjoy the franchise?

Perhaps you weren’t aware the games were all that connected, or maybe you don’t actually care? Do you lament missing out on that aspect of things or have you considered valid reasons to ignore the earlier titles in favour of the ‘RPG Era’ games?

Thanks for reading, would love to get people’s thoughts or even further questions 🙏🏻❤️","416","post"

>The Midnight Walk is a special game and one that tells a deeply affecting story while exploring a range of poignant themes. Its stunning art direction and masterful audio design come together to create an experience unlike any other. Though it offers little in the way of traditional challenge, the emotional journey it delivers lingers long after the credits roll.

>The Midnight Walk is undeniably a big stab at both a moody experience and a satisfying puzzler. MoonHood's debut stumbles a bit at the latter, running into some lacklustre puzzle design and monotony with how scarcely it mixes this up, but it makes up for it in setting. There are a lot of cool, eerie horrors that await on the mountain hike, depicted and animated to unbelievable detail, all the more striking than the last. Backed by enthralling 3D sound design that has you dreading every little footstep of those creepy crawlies, it's a fairy tale horror adventure that is more than the sum of its parts.

>Not since my first time playing Journey has a title struck as strong an emotional chord with my very soul. The claymation world is absolutely beautiful yet terrifying, the soundtrack is hauntingly gorgeous, and the gameplay is full of wildly unique and creative ideas that I've never experienced before.

>The Midnight Walk is a powerful statement representing the often-forgotten artform of claymation. It triumphantly provides a sensory experience that horrifies, chills, and warms your heart with all of its aspects in story, visuals, and sound. Though a bit basic with its gameplay, The Midnight Walk is a masterful work of art with an overflowing amount of love and care poured into the craft where even Henry Selick would be proud.

This short but unforgettable journey, where light and hope struggle with darkness and suffering, not only delights the eyes with its mesmerizing detail, but also with its unique sound and powerful storytelling, will forever remain in our hearts.

>The Midnight Walk is a rare kind of experience—one that feels deeply personal, both in how it’s made and how it plays. Its imperfections are part of its texture: a few underdeveloped mechanics, some narrative murkiness, and an ending that may leave players with more questions than answers.

"kreqex","2025-05-10","[Being an Assassin’s Creed Fan in 2025 Feels... Different] Hey everyone, just to be clear, this post comes from a place of love, not hate. I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed since 2009, and I genuinely enjoy both the classic titles and the newer ones. But ever since Assassin’s Creed Shadows released, it feels like the series has vanished from the spotlight and has just disappeared from conversations.

Discussion around the game is almost nonexistent, I don't see anybody making videos on youtube that aren't AC fans, and even the AC content creators I watch are stepping away due to burnout. This subreddit doesn't seem to be getting the same engagement it once did, and with so many incredible games that have already came out this year, and will come out, many of which are game of the year contenders, Shadows just doesn’t seem to stack up. You might love it, but take personal preference aside and think about the general public.

So I wanted to ask: what do you think needs to change? Because from the outside looking in, it feels like the only people still following the franchise closely are die-hard fans. And honestly, being an AC fan in 2025 almost feels... embarrassing because people write to you weird. I want this series to be beloved again, to be something everyone’s excited to talk about. But it's not like that anymore. I know posting this on an AC subreddit isn't the best idea because naturally there will be people that will hate this post, downvote it and defend the franchise as if there are no flaws, but please put bias aside and let's have a friendly discussion ❤️

What do you all think?


Edit: my point about getting downvoted is sadly proving to be true. It feels like if you say any type of criticism or critique of this franchise on this subreddit, it results in an instant downvote and that's kind of disappointing to see. Why can't we want this franchise to improve 😔 I've not said anything malicious or out of hate. I love this franchise to bits man","397","post"

"Ubi-GoldRaven","2025-03-05","[Assassin's Creed Shadows - Deep Dive into the Hideout] **Hi everyone!** 

Assassin's Creed Shadows is coming on March 20^(th) and we're excited to give you more insight through another gameplay overview article. So far, we've broken down [stealth](https://assassinscreed.com/shadows_stealth_deep_dive), [combat](https://www.assassinscreed.com/shadows_combat_deep_dive), [parkour](https://assassinscreed.com/parkour_overview), [exploration](https://assassinscreed.com/shadows/deep-dive-into-exploration) and [progression](https://assassinscreed.com/shadows/progression_gameplay); we're now wrapping up this series with an extended look at the Hideout - your home and base of operations in the game. The Hideout is a fully customizable sandbox - a first for the series - that empowers Naoe and Yasuke throughout their journey and allows you to build and decorate to your heart's content. 

For additional insights, we'll be joined by Dany, Shadows' systems associate director. Let's take a deeper look! 

All footage is from a work-in-progress build. Please note that some of the videos in this article may be compressed, which could affect their quality. Make sure to watch in 4K for the best quality. HUD settings may vary depending on the capture to showcase examples of customizable options. 

# The Secret Valley of Izumi Settsu 

The Hideout is set in a secluded valley tucked away in the Izumi Settsu province. Surrounded by steep hills on all sides and accessible only through a narrow path in the rocks, its location is either unknown or has been forgotten by most, making it an ideal staging ground and base of operations for your burgeoning league. 

Early in the story, you will get acquainted with its caretaker, Miss Tomiko - a friend and ally of Iga. Resourceful and hard-working, Tomiko has done her best to keep things running, and now with Naoe and Yasuke's help - and with the cornucopia of resources they'll smuggle back during their adventures - this secret valley can finally become the coolest, most intricate Hideout in the history of the Brotherhood. 

""It's pretty ambitious,"" says Dany. ""After fortresses, villas, homesteads, pirate coves, café-theatres, moving trains, ships, settlements, assassin bureaus... We knew that if we wanted to make anything new on that front, we had to take a bold step forward. That meant giving players the option to build their homebase with complete freedom."" 

 

[Assassin's Creed Shadows - Hideout: Entering the Hideout](https://youtu.be/yRLioRU1R5Y)  

 

# An Acre of Land 

With some infrastructure already in place, Tomiko's valley offers a little over one acre of fully customizable land on which players are able to place buildings, pavilions, pathways, bushes, trees, ponds, mossy rocks, local flora & fauna, and countless other Japanese cosmetic elements found or acquired throughout their journey. 

""We really want players to make the Hideout their own"" says Dany. ""Throughout your adventure, most of the content for customization keeps unlocking as you progress, so your customization options will truly reflect your journey."" The building tools are simple enough for everyone to draw up a quick and easy layout, but there's enough depth to sink hours into crafting your vision."" 

 

[Assassin's Creed Shadows - Hideout: Layout Examples](https://youtu.be/bGuPfQRkfxA) 

 

The Hideout will be available for players upon completing the prologue and meeting Tomiko and will then become crucial to your journey across Japan. It will be a place to meet and interact with allies, show off your rewards, and support your progression. 

Building your Hideout will not only let you make the most of your creativity; each building & upgrade will also have a direct impact on gameplay. 

 

# Getting Started 

To start adding new buildings and pavilions to their Hideouts, players will need to gather three different resources that can be found throughout Japan: wood, minerals, and crops. Each new building or upgrade has a set cost of these resources, as well as cost in in-game currency (called ""mons""). 

As highlighted in the [exploration article](https://assassinscreed.com/shadows/deep-dive-into-exploration), players will find small resource bundles that can be directly looted in the Open World, as well as large resource stockpiles they can ""tag"" for their scouts to smuggle out over the course of a season. 

""It was important for us that players would feel the passage of time with seasons"" says Dany. ""Linking smuggling with seasons was a natural choice: it gives players a rhythm to return to the Hideout, review all they gathered and catch up with the inhabitants.""

\# Customization Basics 

Various decorative elements can be obtained as rewards for completing quests, contracts, or activities. Other elements can be purchased in local merchants' stalls or directly looted while skulking the halls of enemy territory. There is also a wide range of animals you can bring to your ","359","post"
"gui_heinen","2025-09-17","[AC Shadows dev speaks for the first time about controversial absence in the game [Claws of Awaji spoilers included]] Like other content creators recently, the Spanish YouTuber ""Rafiti"" (a big fan of AC lore) traveled to the Ubi Bordeaux studios to test Claws of Awaji DLC and managed to get some talks with the expansion's content director (Simon Arseneault), yielding a curious conversation about the subject that has been intriguing the most OG fans: the total absence of the First Civilization in the Shadows universe.

Below is a transcript of their brief conversation on the topic. The full video, as well as the YouTuber's channel with other content and talks with the same director, can be found [here](https://youtu.be/sKl9ugtebpA?si=w_f-jT-5jBanvt2z) (mostly in Spanish).

**Rafiti:** *Can we expect some, maybe... First Civilization content?* 

**Simon:** *Sorry? — he gestures that doesn't understand.*

**Rafiti:** *Isu content. Because in AC shadows main game we don't have anything...*

**Simon:** *Oh, no, no. We stuck with what was done in the base game. So the Isu aren't part of the Japanese universe for now. But that doesn't mean they won't return eventually, or appear later in other content. But it won't be during the Claws of Awaji either. We want to end the story with the same vibe the main game establishes. But with the little ""twist"". With the ""being hunted"" proposition.*

**Rafiti:** *Okay, thank you so much!*

As it's no secret to anyone at this point, Shadows is the first game in the whole saga to not contain any references at all to Isu or Pieces of Eden. And it seems the DLC is no different in this regard. 

What do you guys think about it? I confess that despite not expecting much from this expansion, I ended up being disappointed with the fact that they once again ignored such important element from Assassin's Creed lore, especially under the allegation that the Isu are ""not part of the Japanese universe for now"". 

What would be the implication of that for the game and the pre-established lore, where the presence of the First Civ. had been implied even by those Isu Maps in previous games?!?!","346","post"
"DylenwithanE","2024-12-11","tldr:

**Attacking:**

* Light/Heavy attacks, and charged Light/Heavy attacks (called posture attacks, can be charged indefinitely)
* Yasuke has a unique Sheathed posture attack
* Enemies can briefly enter a 'vulnerable state' where they can take massive damage (initiated through things like perfect dodges)

**Defending:**

* Yasuke's dodges are sidesteps, Naoe's dodges are rolls. (Yasuke's second consecutive dodge will have a recovery period, Naoe's won't)
* Parrying as Yasuke will knock enemies back to be counterattacked. Parrying as Naoe will make her move to the side of the enemy, allowing counterattacks but also opening her up to attacks from other enemies
* Yasuke can block, Naoe can't

**Skills/Abilities:**

* There are some. Including active abilities (probably like Odyssey's) and combo variations (maybe like Horizon's idk). Some introduce new mechanics. Each weapon type has unique Mastery skills and ablities.

**Weapons:**

* Naoe: Katana (sword, allows assassinations through shoji doors), Kusarigama (ball and chain, allows Rush assassinations on enemies up to 10m away), Tanto (dagger) + Hidden Blade (allows DOUBLE ASSASSINATIONS)
* Yasuke: Long Katana (sword), Naginata (glaive/spear thing), Kanabo (club), Yumi bow (multiple arrow types and can be used stealthily), Teppo Rifle

**Enemy types:**

* Outlaws (unusual tactics), Ashigaru soldiers (aggressive towards Naoe, fearful of Yasuke), Ronin (roaming bounty hunters, attack on sight), Samurai (can outsmart shinobi tactics), Samurai Daisho (only in castles), Guardians (reinforcments for when alarm is raised)

**Enemy attacks:**

* Flurry attacks (blue glint, aren't stopped even if parried, parrying every blow causes enemy's vulnerable state), Unstoppable attacks (red glint, blocking or parrying will break your guard, perfect dodging will cause enemy's vulnerable state)

**Enemy defense:**

* Include stepping back or quick counterattacks. Enemies will grow more confident in large numbers and use less defensive tactics.

# PATCH HIGHLIGHTS 

# SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS 

# Critical Role 

For our second special collaboration, we partnered with Critical Role to bring this new content to Assassin's Creed Shadows. This includes a new free quest called ""A Critical Encounter"", a new Ally to recruit and a new trophy/achievement to add to your collection. 

# NEW FREE STORY PACK: ""A CRITICAL ENCOUNTER"" 

Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy. While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. 

Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.

\*Unlock conditions: Complete ""Way of the Blacksmith"" and unlock Yasuke as a playable character. This questline will start in the Hideout. 

* **Reward:** New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo. 
* **New Trophy/Achievement:** ""A Critical Encounter"", received upon completion of the questline. 

With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke. 

# NEW NIGHTMARE DIFFICULTY SETTING 

We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience. 

**Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:** 

* Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels. 
   * E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit - imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage. 
* Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection. 
   * E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving! 
   * E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries - only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state. 
* Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital. 

This is just a glimpse of how this new difficulty setting will impact the game. Don't hesitate to share your most intense moments with us by posting your clips on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ac) or [X](https://x.com/assassinscreed) using #AssassinsCreedShadows.

# Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes 

We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too! 

You will find the option available in the in-game settings. 

* Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).

# VFX Toggles 

Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more. 

All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.

"Limp-Grapefruit-6251","2025-09-09","[Quite unbelievable that, since 2017, Mirage has been the only game that feels like an Assassin's Creed.] Hold your horses now! With this I don't mean that all the RPG AC games are bad (as some might instead think).


But realistically speaking; won't you agree that Mirage has been, so far, the only AC that somewhat felt like an Assassin's creed game ? Unlike all the others.


Brief recap :

- Origins, gameplay heavily into rpg mechanics, hidden blade needed upgrades, minimal parkour. The story acted as the origin of the Brotherhood, which was actually good tho. (8/10)

- Odyssey never even tried to be an AC, no hidden blade, no equivalent of the Brotherhood, therfore no Assassin's, very deep into the Mythical lore, super warrior-combat. Very great game tho. Too bad it's nothing like an AC. (9/10)

- Valhalla, Eivor blatantly says he's no assassin and he even wears the blade as he please. Stealth feels super unnecessary, parkour is goofy. I'd describe it by saying ""waiter, there's a bit of assasin in my viking game"" (6/10)


- Mirage, controversial combat but finally something that won't make you look like a God or a insurmountable wall that's unfazed by anything. Great map that's fun traversal, dynamic stealth options, the whole Assassin's theme is back and the story is about Assassin's once again. (8/10)


- Shadows, Naoe is great but she can only truly shine in castles since there are not many other places with high density/tall buildings. The story feels like it's shy about the templar and Assassin's so it only use them as background noise basically. She even creates her own league, which is inspired by the Brotherhood but it isn't. So many unnecessary escamotages. Why can't you be a normal AC ? Traversal is boring btw. (7/10)



#the (scores) are what I personally gave to those games, as games in general.


If I had to score them as Assassin's Creed games :

Origins = 6 (story saves it)

Odyssey = 3

Valhalla = 4

Mirage = 8

Shadows = 5



I truly believe Assassin's Creed never released a (main-ish) game I didn't like. But after Syndicate it kept releasing bad ""Assassin's Creed games"" yet good games per sè. If that makes sense to y'all.","300","post"
"Viliar","2025-03-30","[Game designer here! Finished the game. Here is my feedback and QoL suggestions.] Hi all!

My name is Baz and I'm a game developer with 11+ years of experience both on mobile and PC/console titles. I'm also a long time fan of AC. Finished all the mainline titles and a fair bunch of mobile/web games in the series. I took a 10 days of vacation just to complete Shadows in one go and I loved it. Managed to pull that off in 90 hours on max difficulty. Before I'll jump to Quality of Life suggestions which can be done without reworking huge chunks of game I'd like to give a general feedback. English is not my first language so please don't overreact if I make some mistakes =)

**General Feedback**

Shadows is obviously the next iteration of Anvil and the first title in new generation of AC games. Absolutely mind blowing improvement in graphics, combat, stealth, investigations and customization. That being said, I think there are twomajor problems we need to point out.

First and the most important is **narrative.**

While the game is perfect for newcomers it really lacks franchise gimmicks for long time fans like me. There is no confrontation in Grey after you kill the target, there is no final one-liner like ""Requiescat in pace"" or ""The lord of the Duat awaits"", no Assassin bureaus. But most importantly there is no Isu structures which used to make already exotic settings even more exotic and no japanese guild (league) of Assassins' Brotherhood. We want to call things with their intended names. Not Hidden Ones, not Kakushiba ikki, not League of the Hidden Blade but Assassin's Brotherhood. Game's logo reveal in the 3d act is kinda illogical. The character that created it had literally zero reason to do so.

And modern day... I really miss it. When community asked to get rid of it people talked about the games where it was badly written and not because they hated the idea itself. Modern day story was a glue that connected games and gave a sense of leading up to smth. Now it's just letters and some vague visions. Really wish it was revisited and elevated. ACIII modern day story was perfect and not because of Desmond (pick anyone for all I care) but because it had playable missions. Dropping Basim as potential MD Animus operator is a crime in my book.

Second is **combat balance**.

The combat itself is really deep, progression is good, I've played with it a lot. But it kinda stops working at some point and everything becomes easy. And the reason to that is buried in the attributes of enemies. While level (hence damage output, armor and health) scale with the player's level there is no increase in affliction resistance. If you manage to make a build that, for example, easily triggers Daze, then enemy has no counter measure to that. I'd really like to see enemies which are hard not because they one-shot me, or because they have too much health/armor but because they are resistant to my tricks.

Now let's jump to QoL suggestions!

**Equipment**

* Change the color of the smaller sword when you transmog Yasuke's big katana
* Stat page
* Marking items as favorite
* Hide weapons
* Move ammo pouch from front to back of the belt for Yasuke. I'd really like to see customization most of the time similar to quiver of the bow
* Torch
* Yellow attributes need to be better. Right now they happen to be even worse then common
* Option to be delete preset or copy the current one and overwrite one of the existing is a must. It was in Odyssey, wish it was there from the start
* An option to either turn kusarigama chain sound off or an option to make it fabric (hence with no sound). right now it might be quite annoying to constantly hear it 99% of the time during traversal
* Naginata's finisher with cutting off hands and head is too long
* Tanto preview needs to change. I'd like to see scabbard along with the blade. Would be much better to showcase it similar to swords with focus on scabbard AND weapon
* Valhalla had multiple really distinct Assassin outfits. Shadows only has 2 sets with insignia + recolors. Feels subpar, really wish more Assassin themed outfits be here
* Save transmog to loadouts

**Abilities**

* It's really strange to have an ability slots limit that severe. In Odyssey we could equip up to... 12 abilities I believe. And now we only have 3 at a time. Why can't I equip 2 abilities from Samurai tree for example? Or 3 from Katana tree? Or have 4 active allies instead of 2? There are buttons here. Would it really mess the balan
* Would be nice to include equipped abilities in the loadout. some weapon combinations make more sense with certain abilities
* Ally abilities cooldown is too long without perk for its reduction. Literally to the point I can't use them for so long I forget about them. Game's pacing is much higher then these cooldown is balanced for
* Hard Fall perk for Kusarigama has to go. it's too much OP. You can always immediately deel ability and weapon damage, after which enemy is depraved of attacking at al","299","post"

# Patch Highlights

# Corrupted Castles

Corrupted Castles are a new Animus themed activity allowing you to revisit castles in a whole new way. Previously completed castles may now become corrupted. They will now be filled with Animus anomalies such as Corrupted Samurai Daisho that patrol with heightened aggression and altered patterns. Kill them all to unlock a Corrupted Castle's chest that awards Gear and Gold, making each assault a meaningful experience.

Starting at level 30 and after completing at least 3 castles, up to five corrupted castles will appear on the map each season, giving you plenty of opportunities to re-engage the castles at higher levels for greater rewards.

# New Parkour Update

Following our first Parkour update, we’ve listened to your feedback and we’re coming back with more! The team has made some tweaks and improvements to enhance your experience traversing Feudal Japan. 

Here are the main changes and additions!



# Advanced Parkour Feature

We are adding a new toggle option named “Advanced Parkour” that gives players more freedom of expression. When toggled through the gameplay menu, it removes all parkour barriers, meaning you can perform side and back ejects from any height. *Time to risk life and limb for those death-defying parkour runs!*



# Advanced Parkour: Side & Back Ejects

The Advanced Parkour option also brings refined control for side and back ejects. Pressing Parkour Up while jumping to the side or back will still give you the height to reach your landing spot. This has not changed since the previous parkour update.

However, if a decent landing spot is not available, you will now launch sideways or behind as far as possible, without any height restriction. 

  
[Assassin's Creed Shadows: Advanced Parkour - Side & Back Ejects](https://youtu.be/WmVE_VFVasc)

 

# Advanced Parkour: Side Eject Down

Performing a side eject with parkour down will send you downward at a sharp angle, generally closer to your starting point, meaning you will never gain any height.

The Advance Parkour option enables subtle changes that we hope the parkour aficionados out there will enjoy!

# General Parkour Improvements

Let’s now look at our overall parkour improvements (the ones that will work whether you toggle the Advanced Parkour option on/off).

# Vertical Ledge Grab (Non-Standing Objects)

We are extending the Vertical Ledge Grab ability to now include Non-Standing Objects such as beams, lanterns and more. Another small, but impactful parkour tweak!



[Assassin's Creed Shadows: Vertical Ledge Grab (Non-Standing Objects)](https://youtu.be/7MH9uQH_HFk)

 

# Manual Jump (Non-Standing Objects)

From the same Non-Standing Objects, we are introducing a new Manual Jump option. This enables you to refine the parkour experience, by making creative shortcuts when running along rooftops or beams.

This is not a full manual jump. This only works from Non-Standing Objects.

# Directional Catch Ledge

And finally, we are re-introducing a highly requested feature called the Directional Catch Ledge. Simply press towards the nearest ledge and tap the Parkour Up button to catch that ledge and prevent your character from falling.

This works from any height, and it is particularly useful when combined with the Advanced Parkour option, or when you overestimate your grapple hook d","251","post"

# PATCH HIGHLIGHTS  

# NEW EXPANSION: CLAWS OF AWAJI COMING SEPTEMBER 16TH

A storm is coming.  

A new threat rises from across Osaka Bay as rumors surface of a hidden blade wielding shinobi, and of a long-lost relic. Naoe and Yasuke journey to a new land in search of answers, but find themselves surrounded by danger, ensnared in the Claws of Awaji.   

In this expansion to Assassin's Creed Shadows, discover a new island region dominated by the Sanzoku Ippa, a nefarious faction intent on uncovering the final Regalia. Avoid traps and ambushes as you track >!the legendary Fujibayashi Tsuyu!<, and as Naoe, master the new Bo staff to eliminate enemies with tactical efficiency. New legendary gear, skills and abilities also await across more than 10 hours of additional content. 

https://preview.redd.it/zc88r04x1dof1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=033b9bb75b7a32bc85bf9b147b4f4f2ed74e830d

*We also would like to inform MacOS users eligible for the Claws of Awaji DLC that the content may not be accessible immediately after launching the game for the first time following the release of the DLC.*    
   
*To resolve this, please launch the game while connected online, then close it and reboot—either online or offline—to ensure the DLC becomes available.*

 

# NEW FREE STORY QUEST: GO WITH THE BO 

Join Junjiro in his quest to meet a legendary Bo Master and learn more about the Bo staff, a dynamic new weapon type perfectly suited to Naoe's acrobatic fighting style. Upon finishing the quest, you will receive a Bo to use across your adventures.  

Originally developed exclusively for the Claws of Awaji expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone... for FREE! You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16th.   

https://preview.redd.it/vcaprs102dof1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=849a8d37f3e2958f5b04968cb408ffcf5a7bdc93

 

# Level Cap Increase 

To support the launch of the Claws of Awaji expansion we've raised the level cap to 100, giving players more room to grow and more options to customize their builds.  

 

# New Hideout Upgrades 

With the new update, each unique building now includes 2 additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside 3 new Hideout levels. 

These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.  

 

# Advance Time of Day 

By upgrading the Nando to level 2, the player will gain the ability to meditate and skip time forward to the next 6 o'clock (AM or PM). To activate meditation, find a safe location and hold the up button (L on keyboard). This allows Naoe and Yasuke to prepare for nighttime assault and be ready to strike \[#@!%&\*\] Castle at night.  

 

# Improved Scouts  

Upgrading the Study to level 4 now allows Scouts to reveal both Viewpoints and Safehouses. Discovering Safehouses is especially valuable, as it enables Naoe and Yasuke to join the action more quickly by reducing their travel time. 

And with the Kakurega upgraded to level 4, uncovering all Viewpoints within a province will also reveals the entire province automatically, giving players full visibility of its terrain and strategic locations. *No more fog!*

 

# Enhanced Gear Quality  

By upgrading the Forge to level 6, Naoe and Yasuke gain the ability to enhance their gear to new quality tiers: Mythic and Artifact. Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential. 

Epic items can be transformed into Mythic items, which improve their stats with each level, add a Boosted Stat if one wasn't present, and boost non-legendary perks, including the one in the engraving slot, by 50% at level 5 and 100% at level 9. \_(For perks related to damage reduction, refill ration, ammo, or tools, this bonus is halved, capping at a 50% increase at level 9.)\_

"Capn_C","2025-11-27","[AC Shadows Game Director confirms there are no plans for a 2nd DLC expansion] >""As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years. And whether or not this is the the right way to go, I think it's more an experience we're trying, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it.""

The director admitting that Ubisoft's original Season Pass plans for Shadows (2 DLC Expansions) changed after the game was delayed:

>""I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations. The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. The planning for the post launch was not really clear as it would have been on \[previous AC games\] where the technology is more stable and well known. We started fairly late on Shadows to see...because I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass. And that situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production.""","242","post"
"Cursed_69420","2025-11-02","[Bloodborne in 2025 is a fantastic experience and playing it made me realize 4 things - How a game can be overhyped overtime despite being fairly good, Why Miyazaki NEEDED to change his boss designs, and Why playing Souls game in release order is ideal, and how DS3 was crafted in less than 2 years.] **NOTES -**

* This review is structured into first the Notes part, then the detailed review of the game itself, some rankings and favorites overall, and then i will elaborate on the three things i meant from the title.
* I played the game on my PC via ShadPS4, with a Keyboard and Mouse, and fully offline. 60Fps was a bliss. This is probably one of my LAST leftover souls games (only other notable ones of this year). So i will consider myself pretty adept in this genre.
* I knew the names of all the bosses and how their arenas look, even the good and the bad ones, but had little idea on what their moveset, world placement, and lore was. Example, i knew there was Darkbeast Paarl, Gascoigne or Cleric Beast somewhere, but idk where that is, and only when upon seeing the arena and maybe the boss corpse (like paarl) i was like oh they that's the boss, time to learn it's moveset.
* I already knew many mechanics well, such as Trick Weapons (but only saw cleaver lol), Rally, Interrupt, Charged Backstabs etc. Plus all the familiar souls mechanics.
* Boss Fights are a very important criteria for me when judging a soulslike. So by the title you can tell I'm gonna be slightly critical of them.

After 4 years of just knowing tidbits of this game, I have finally completed the game. I will not lie, it lives up to it's cult following, and is a genuine masterpiece in a lot of aspects, with the only notable exception being boss fights. I've decided to split the discussion into Overwheling positive, Positive, 50/50, Negative, and Overwhelming negative. Let's start -

**Overwhelming Positives -** This is for the objective positive and near zero flaws category

1. **World Design (Layout)** \- Wow, just WOW. The layout of Yharnam is just immaculate. from Central Yharnam's brilliant design, to Cathedral Ward's ""the middle ground of many areas"" design was just breathtaking. the way that CW leads to like 4 different locations, and allows you to go anywhere early is peak Fromsoft gaming. Bloodborne hands down has the best designed world layout in any fromsoft game.
2. **World Design (Individual)** \- Even individual levels themselves were well done, and in may ways show how Elden Ring and DS3 were able to create equally good if not better designed isolated areas thanks to this game's influence. Nightmare of Mensis's triple elevator shortcut, or Old Yharnam's entire loop were so fun to unlock and felt very natural, and did not feel like a comically large ladder or elevator placed there for no purpose.
3. **Lore and characters**\- I am still diving into it. It's brilliant and so well elaborated. It's miles better than anything in Elden Ring, Sekiro and Demon's Souls.
4. **Aesthetics and Artstyle -** As much as i like to joke on the Black palette, it defo adds to the vibe and to the cohesion of the world and it's believe-ability. plus the occasional blood moons, silver moons also add much needed vibrancy when needed.
5. **Arsenal -** I genuinely appreciate the small amount of arsenal that they decided to stick to. Helps avoid unnecessary bloat, and each weapon has enough complexity and modability via gems. weapons particularly have some downsides but i'll get to them later.
6. **Audios and OSTs -** yeah already added like half the tracks into my souls playlists. Theyre PEAK. obviously Gascoigne, Cleric Beast, Ludwig were pretty well reputed, but i'm surprised as to how much Amygdala and Darkbeast's themes slap. The audios of objects, wind, npcs and enemies were also well crafted.
7. **Questlines and Hidden Details -** Iosekfa's questline, Eileen my wife, Arianna's Questline, the subtle hints of a grander scheme, the eventual reveal of snake men, spiders and tentacles was very very creative to unpack and experience.
8. **(Controversial) Runbacks** \- I fucking love runbacks (only if they are well executed and unlocked naturally). BB has so many good and creative runbacks i love it.

Okay i realized i am sounding like a generic NPC or a chatbot with these statements but trust me i will get to the details now.

**General Positives -** good stuff with some notable flaws

1. **Weapons -** 60-70 Percent of the weapons are genuinely good and very well varied. However, some weapons are straight up useless and very very one note/underpowered, especially the Boomhammer, Kos Parasite, Bolt Mace whatever, and the Reiterpallash and gunrifle thingy.
2. **Graphics -** LOOK, its on PC with shadps4. There were some issues but generally the game looked good, but also a bit dry in texturing and actual fidelity. but that's fromsoft and a minor issue in the grand scheme of the game.
3. **Enemies -** i'd say, 75 percent of the enemies were memorable, elaborate, a","236","post"

"MacGyvini","2025-08-26","[Ac Shadows unnecessarily huge map. And it’s consequences] For a starter this game has a total of 12 main targets. The Shinbakfu. Half of those are located in just 2 provinces (Settsu and Yamashiro). Meanwhile the map has a total of 9 provinces. One of this provinces is mostly a huge lake (Omi with Lake Biwa).

The Onryo Samurai - Settsu
The Naginata - Omi
The Fool - Yamashiro
The Mourner - Omi
The Wounded - Settsu
The Two Faced - Yamashiro
The Horseman - Yamashiro
The Noble - Harima
The Golden Teppo - Settsu
The Ox - Harima
The Wise - Yamato
The Fox - Wakasa

Despite most of these targets being relatively random. And that has no connection to the main characters. We could remove most of them and we wouldn’t even remember. Like most of AC games. Where most of the targets are just names and faces we don’t have any attachments to. In Shadows they aren’t even Names or Faces. They are just masks. Then we discover who they really are in a not so twist. As if we were supposed to care about them. After a total of 2 cutscenes and one line of dialogue. The Shinbakfu could’ve been easily made up by 6 enemies. And the game set in just 3 or 4 provinces.

Another issue with the map that comes with this unnecessary bloat of targets and places, all of the mountains and hills that the player can’t properly explore. Plus the fact that large chunks of the map are simply empty or with repetitive activities. We have 37 temples that require us to find the missing pages. Plus all of the temples that have nothing. Just POI that has no interest in it.

Forts or enemy camps that are always located on the side of the road. Taking away the need of exploration. 

Quantity for the sake of quantity. 

All of the side activities that give the player Knowledge Ranks. Temples, Shrines, Taka, Horse Archery, Kuji-kiri, Kofun, Hidden Trails. 

There are 12 skill trees. We need to reach Knowledge Rank 6 to be able to unlock every skill.

37 Temples
10 Kofuns
22 Kuji-kiri
18 Kata
10 Horse Archery
10 Hidden Trailer
27 Shrines.

There are 137 Knowledge Points to get. You would need 45 Knowledge points to get to Rank 5. You unlock most of the Skill tree (some of the skills are locked behind missions) by Rank 6. There are around 70 Knowledge points thar are completely unnecessary. It’s just bloat for the sake of it.

Quantity over Quality.

The bigger the game gets, the worse the story is, the worse the voice acting is, the worse the cutscenes are.","222","post"
"gui_heinen","2025-11-27","[""The Puzzlement"" quest is a reminder of why many fans don't take Ubi Quebec seriously anymore [AC Shadows Spoilers]] The quest that was announced a month ago as an [""Isu Puzzle""](https://xcancel.com/assassinscreed/status/1981752544960418177#m), also the first content related to the *Precursors* in the Shadows universe, is not only disappointing in essence, but also hilarious, since it summarizes, in my opinion, the spirit of Ubisoft Quebec.

A cave masquerading as an ""Isu Vault"" (beams of light on simple stones and a random globe) with Greek, Norse & Egyptian artifacts, plus a statue of Kassandra from AC's 15th Anniversary and a handful of precursor weapons that Misthios swore to rid the world of centuries ago. That sums up Shadows' idea of what the First Civilization is... At this point, I think it would be better to simply stick to the prior assumption that not every adventure needs to stumble upon the Isu, even though that has always been the essence of the saga after all.

Such low-budget mission even surprises me, TBH, considering that the game's associate director [confirmed](https://xcancel.com/Memento_Gallery/status/1993096115999109554#m) recently that MTX in games are used to fund this type of post-launch content — maybe we need more recolor skins for the Animus Store, right!?","217","post"

# NEW GAME+ 

**New Game+ is coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows!**

Upon completing the main story on any difficulty, start a new game while keeping all collected skills, gear, Allies and hideout progression from your first playthrough. You can start a New Game+ playthrough from the Memory Menu in the Animus after finishing all journeys of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro. 

Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough you'll be awarded Whisper of Gold, and Dragon's Gold! Brand new gold plated Legendary Long Katana and Legendary Katana with their own unique perk engravings. 

Take your journey through Feudal Japan to the next level as many times as you want... or at least up to 8 times with New Game+! With each new venture into New Game+, face stronger foes, more demanding challenges, and tests of your Shinobi and Samurai skills.  

https://preview.redd.it/ubhtcv2vdmff1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9efa5005b95e8901b5db8b64054eea73c916e12

# KNOWLEDGE RANK & LEVEL CAP INCREASE 

Prepare to push beyond your limits! We've raised the level cap from 60 to 80, meaning tougher foes with enhanced tactics and awareness - demanding sharper reflexes and smarter strategies. 

To meet this rising threat, we've also expanded the Knowledge Rank system to 9 & 10 allowing players to unlock and develop a broader array of skills, passives, and combat techniques to become even more masterful. 

New Game+ awaits! But before taking on the task of a new journey, you can upgrade the passives and skills of Naoe and Yasuke! Players will gain 1 new rank for multiple nodes in their Mastery Skills, and 10 new ranks for all existing Knowledge passives to become even more formidable. 

A test of your skills is no match without the right gear! The Forge can now be upgraded to level 4, allowing players to upgrade all weapons and gear to level 80 to have the edge on the rising threats that await. 

With new levels and ranks, come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked: 

* **Enjoy the Ride:** Reach Level 80 
* **Stars Unseen:** Reach Knowledge Rank 10 
* **Worth its Wait:** Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana (by completing the story on New Game+).

# ANIMUS RIFT

Respond to The Guide's call and journey into a deeper layer of the Animus where a new mystery awaits. 

Rifts are a deeper layer of simulation within the Animus - mysterious and fractured spaces where the Animus interprets genetic information in unusual ways. While some Rifts are solely used for communication across space and time, others may carry challenges and secrets that have long remained hidden - until now.  

The new quest, ***Chained*** will be present on the Animus Board after players have unlocked Yasuke in the Open World, and completed ***From Spark to Flame*** to access the Animus System.

# NEW ANIMUS HUB PROJECT - MNEMOSYNE

We are releasing a new Project available in the Animus HUB called ***Mnemosyne***. Just like in our other Projects, complete Anomalies and gather data fragments to progress and claim Animus-themed gear, weapons and much more! 

The items claimed through the Animus HUB will be transferred to the players' Inventory. 

To access these features, players need to have progressed enough to unlock Yasuke in the Open World and completed ***From Spark to Flame*** to access the Animus System.

# ADDITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 

* Removed a performance warning on MacBook Air when using M4 following improved support. 
* Fixed an error in Photo Mode where the ""Show UI"" prompt was visible in preview mode, affecting players taking screenshots with their native systems. 
* Individual items will now have their dedicated page within the store.

"AssassinsCrypt","2025-05-12","First of all, thanks! I always love to being able to provide a direct feedback that will be (hopefully) listened! In my opinion, the game would benefit with some Gameplay Improvements:

1. **The Hideout**: so far, it's a place that you only visit for the Forge, without proper gameplay features/activities. What about a ""*Trading System""*, in where you can sell the resources that you gather from the enemy camps, sending them to other outposts/cities/locations? Something similar to AC3 or the more recent ""Wrath of the Druids"" Valhalla's DLC;
2. **Scouts** **and Allies**: After finishing the main story, Scouts are mostly used for reducing the Wanted Level. It would be interesting to being able to use them in some ""*Dispatch Missions*"", like the ones in the Ezio Trilogy: in this way, they could be used for something else as well!
3.  **Bounties**: Odyssey had weekly bosses/mercenaries to hunt down. The in-game conctracts already have something similar, but they could be expanded: maybe it could be fun to have a ""*Bounty hunting*"" mechanic, in where Yasuke (or Naoe) could be asked to find and hunt down Ronin or Bandits - maybe have some special weekly ones to find and defeat (for Yasuke) or to assassinate (for Naoe)!
4. **Conquest Battles**: I've always liked how you were able, in Odyssey, to increase or reduce the ""power"" of a faction the game's regions, with the epic Conquest Battles in the end. I guess that it's way too late for add a similar ""Power system"" in the game, but maybe there could be some random ""*Power Struggles*"" around the map: battles between two factions that you can join, helping one of the sides. 
5. **Minigames**: that's definetly the least-necessary thing, but would be fun to have some classic japanese minigames to play, like Dices, Shogi or Hanafuda;

Some minor gameplay improvements could be:

1. Ability of change the time of the day (maybe by sleeping in one of our bases?);
2. Ability to turn off the Seasons Change, at least with the Fast Travel;

**Story wise**, we need more meaningful contents that explore and expand the game's Lore: Assassins, Templars and Isu. Even some collectibles would be fine, I just feel the need of more ***heavy Lore*** stuff in Shadows!","206","comment"

"annatheginguh","2025-03-19","[Assassin’s Creed Shadows - A Review, by annatheginguh] Hello, everyone! I have had the opportunity to play Assassin's Creed Shadows early, so I would like to share my thoughts gathered from roughly 50 hours of play time so far. 

I will discuss general gameplay, such as stealth, combat, and parkour, and new mechanics like seasons, the Hideout, and the new Photo Mode. I will also address the execution of various philosophies such as the dual protagonists and exploration. I will not, however, be discussing any story, so this review will be fully spoiler-free. 

To begin, I would like to address the Photo Mode. I was very excited when I learned we would be getting a new Photo Mode. I have loved taking pictures in AC, so I was thrilled to know the tool would be receiving improvements — and it has met those expectations… mostly.

The increased camera range makes it easier to get wide landscape shots. The focal length also boasts an impressive range, allowing players to bring the camera view very close to their subject (as a prolific user of close-ups, I am very pleased with it). However, on the opposite end of the slider, the range is rather deficient; the focal length does not allow for wider shots or any style that might use such FOV. 

The depth-of-field options are, regrettably, quite poor. The focal distance slider is too coarse to take some close-ups without compromising focal length and camera position. I have been able to work around it, but I would like to not have to make such compromises. I am very pleased with the improvements made to the Photo Mode, but there is still room for more. 

While many AC fans, myself included, lament the lack of social stealth, the game mostly makes up for it in its diverse tool set of physical stealth options. Naoe can go prone, reducing her profile and putting her out of sight. The grapple hook and swing makes it possible to cross a large area of a camp with ease. 

The light and shadow mechanic adds a new level to stealth as well. One can hide in the shadow cast by the moon and wait for a patrolling enemy to come around. Players can extinguish lanterns and candles to further reduce ambient light. However, the game will sometimes decide a candle cannot be extinguished as there is no prompt to do so. This is often a source of frustration when making a stealthy approach entirely in the shadows. 

Naoe can utilize Shinobi Bells to distract enemies, but only one guard at a time will investigate. If the player would like to distract more than one enemy simultaneously (say, away from a doorway), one will have to make a bigger distraction, such as an explosion using powder barrels or leaving a body where a guard might find it, thereby causing a big enough scene to pull multiple enemies away from their posts. This, however, runs the risk of detection as enemies will be more alert. I do not know if this is by design, but I would prefer a quieter way to distract multiple enemies. 

As for using stalking zones, I have encountered some issues with the ""blend"" zone in bushes and ground cover not being uniform to the model. There are times when I prone crawl in an area with ground cover to hide from investigating enemies, but when I move to avoid their path, I am suddenly exposed and thrust into combat. This is not helped by the fact that HUD feedback for the direction of enemy detection is not precise enough to be helpful. For example, I get a detection notice directly from the right. I turn my camera right, but suddenly the detection icon indicates they are to the left. I swing back and find that the enemy is in fact above me, but now it is too late to evade and I am fully detected. There are small elements that need addressing, but overall, stealth works and allows for freedom in approach. 

Combat is, to put it plainly, fun. It is engaging and punishing, forcing players to pay attention to the enemies' patterns in relation to their own control inputs. Each encounter has a chance to end in defeat if the player approaches too arrogantly with the assumption they will be victorious. Moreover, the difficulty arises in the enemy's technique, not health pool. Players must use their skills, both those unlocked in the Mastery Tree and those gained by practice, to best their foes. Tougher enemies require attentiveness and precision. While they do often have more health, it is not to an unreasonable degree. The combat is balanced and rewarding to those who earn competency with its system. 

There are clear improvements to parkour since the first gameplay showcase in June 2024. Movement is not perfect, but it is leagues better than what players saw before. Combining dodge and parkour down adds a new level of control that recent titles lack. That said, actions are still highly contextual, and it is difficult to tell whether the game will let you perform a certain action. Parkour up is frustrating because the focus is on using Naoe's grappling hook to ascend, so refined climbing controls are ","204","post"

# Special Collaboration: Attack On Titan 

With a kidnapped Titan-Shifter as their weapon, a mysterious, power-hungry faction has infiltrated feudal Japan, setting their sights on total domination. 

But when an attempt to rescue the Shifter fails, the lone survivor (with a dark secret) recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help her stop the group from unleashing the terror of a Titan on Japan.

 ***Please note that this is a time-limited quest that is available from November 25th - December 22nd.*** 

The quest giver is in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower (the icon is displayed on the map). Note that the quest will not be within the objective board until the player interacts with the quest giver. 

***Unlock conditions: Unlock Yasuke as a playable character.*** 



During the quest, players can find customization for their hideout (banners and a statue) and upon quest completion, players will earn a crystal katana for Naoe.

# New Story Quest: A Puzzlement 

Who is up for some friendly competition? 

**""A Puzzlement""** is the 3rd story drop coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows. In this fun and humorous quest, Naoe and Yasuke encounter two old acquaintances having a loud argument about a mysterious door in south Wakasa. They task our protagonists with figuring out how to open it. 

https://preview.redd.it/jeurj9yp283g1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55c101971408abf98cfe242903d038152ff7c204

During the quest, Naoe and Yasuke will learn new skills from each other: 

* Naoe will learn how to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke's war kick ability. 
* Yasuke will learn how to stealthily dispatch enemies in a non-lethal way.

You may also finally be able to settle the debate as to who would win in a straight up duel between our two protagonists. Have no fear, the duel is purely friendly, and totally harmless. 

As the name suggests, **""A Puzzlement""**, also introduces a brand new and intricate environmental puzzle for players to discover.

"kszaku94","2025-01-01","[Sekiro: Back to basics] Sekiro: *Shadows Die Twice* was the best game I played last year. Hell, it might be the best game I’ve played, period. Every action game I play from that point on will be compared to *Sekiro* in my mind. I mentioned that already in my end-of-the-year list, but since the worst game I played last year (a stinker called *Devil May Cry 2*) got its own review, I think *Sekiro* deserves one even more.

And yes, action game. Not a ""soulslike"" (whatever that means), not an ""action RPG,"" just an action game. It is very important to mention that because I’ve noted that people come to this game with the wrong idea, expecting ""Samurai Dark Souls."" It has very little in common with typical FromSoft RPGs. There are no endless lists of stats, perks, and items. You have two stats: health and attack power. Health is upgraded each time you collect four prayer beads, not unlike in games like *Bayonetta* or *Devil May Cry.* I’m hesitant to even call attack power a ""stat,"" because you can only upgrade it after beating each of the main bosses. It’s a great feature thematically, though.

*Sekiro* is a very refined and stripped-down action game. There are no flashy combos, no rating systems, and no style meters. There’s basically one context-sensitive attack, blocking and parrying, and some special techniques. The main character can also use his shinobi prosthetic to tilt battles in his favor. This forces a certain playstyle on the player. Unlike other action games (like *Devil May Cry*), you don’t have a ""get out of jail free"" card in the form of healing items you can spam from the menu. For as fun and challenging as *DMC* is, I often find myself using consumables to skip parts that annoy me ever so slightly. This is less of a problem on higher difficulties, but since those are unlocked only after beating the game on Normal, one could potentially beat a boss without truly learning its mechanics. Arguably, this is reflected in a lower *Devil Hunter Rank,* but I don’t really care about those all that much.

While *Sekiro* also allows for mid-fight healing, it has a brilliant design choice: healing (or using any item, for that matter) locks the player character in an animation, putting them in a vulnerable state that enemies are often programmed to exploit. All of this puts the player in a position where they have to learn enemy moves and openings to succeed.

And yes, this can be as frustrating as you might imagine. *Sekiro* is absolutely willing to put a brick wall of a boss in front of the player and not move it an inch until they can overcome it through sheer skill. In that, it represents the best adaptation of classic 2D action games like *Castlevania* into 3D. It’s less about spectacle and more about learning how to perform a no-hit run and succeeding at it.

There is, however, one interesting spin *Sekiro* throws into the mix: the posture system. Each attack on any character—be it the player, a common enemy, or a boss—inflicts damage to posture, regardless of whether it was parried, blocked, or went through their defense. The posture system rewards aggressive play and encourages players to take the time to learn enemy moves and game systems (like the Mikiri counter). Also, the audiovisual feedback of a successful perfect parry will probably never get old for me.

So, yeah... *Sekiro* is perfect. I might have a love-hate relationship with the game at times, but I cannot think of any modern title that respects and rewards the player as much as this one does. We might never get another *Sekiro,* given *Elden Ring’s* monumental success. People just seem to prefer open-world RPGs.

And that’s okay. Because we have *Sekiro.*","171","post"

"bluuuuueeeeeee","2025-03-30","[Are you having fun playing AC Shadows?] I want to caveat this up front by saying I was really excited for the release of AC Shadows and think it is a massive improvement over Valhalla especially. I’m thrilled that it’s having such a positive reception and have enormous respect for the devs who clearly put their hearts and souls into it. However, I’m 10 hours so far and I’m just… not really having fun? 

Naoue and Yasuke are compelling characters and I love how deeply we get to know them - particularly Naoue. The story also makes a lot of sense and at no point am I confused about my character’s motivations. Then there’s the stunning visuals and the dense, rich environment. I’m constantly amazed at how lush the flora is. Despite all this though, I wouldn’t say that I’m “having fun” playing the game and I can’t quite put my finger on why that is. 

I have a few theories:

1. Combat with Naoue - I get that she’s a stealth character, but inevitably you get stuck in combat encounters from time to time and they’re incredibly repetitive. I’m sure that will change in the later game once I unlock more abilities, but I have yet to have a “holysh*t that was so f**king cool” moment in combat like I did in Odyssey (Spartan kicking an enemy off a cliff will never get old).

2. Lack of fun side quests - This has been raised in this sub already, but I really miss the lighthearted and varied side quests that the other ACs have had. They help deepen your connection to the land and its people, and give a much-needed break from the seriousness of the main storyline. From what I understand, Naoue has barely left Iga in her life. Surely connecting with other regions and communities should be an integral part of her journey?

3. Meditation breaks - I’m 50/50 on these. On the one hand, I love the opportunities to learn more about Iga and the events leading up to the present day. On the other hand, I find them too long and the addition of gameplay within them takes me out of the groove of whatever I was doing before. 

4. Unrewarding exploration - This has also been mentioned in this sub so I won’t dwell on it, but I don’t have the same drive to explore every corner of the map like I do with, say, Breath of the Wild or even Hogwarts Legacy (which has its own problems with repetitive gameplay).

To end on a positive note, I’m still really happy with the game and think it was a massive step forward for Ubisoft. After so many failures they needed a home run with this game and they delivered. I can’t give enough credit to the dev teams for what they produced. I like the game a lot but I hope they make a few changes so I can start loving it. 

I’m curious to hear what you all think. Am I missing something here?","154","post"

"manit14","2025-03-17","[I finally finished every main game, my thoughts:] I started playing the Ezio collection on switch more than two years ago after I got it for a Christmas gift. I've always loved the cinematic trailers but assumed the games themselves weren't good, mostly because of online influences like Video Game Dunkey. They blew my every expectation out of the water, so I continued on and made it a goal to play them all. Finally, after all this time, I finished Mirage then went back and played through AC1. I finished last Tuesday and I've been thinking about them since.

I've decided that I really love this franchise. Heck, I decided that ages ago. It's very flawed and very messy at times, but I've found a way to enjoy almost every entry. Even ones I thought I was going to dislike, I ended up liking. I think this is the first time a series has made such an impact upon me that I bought every single game and played them all. I'm usually more of an Edward Kenway when it comes to acquiring video games, but this franchise was special enough to me to make me *want* to buy them. 

I could go on but I don't want this to end up a 10 page essay, Times New Roman, 12-point font, double spaced (not including works cited). So I'll just leave on this: I love Altair's character development. I love... everything about Ezio. I love AC3's combat (and cinemtic trailer, best one imo). I love sailing in Black Flag. I love the concept behind Rogue. I love parkour and black box missions in Unity. I actually loved the grappling hook thing in Syndicate. I loved climbing the pyramids in Origins, I loved Kassandra saying Malaka, I loved the expansive feel to Valhalla, and I loved the blend of old and new mechanics in Mirage.

In spite of critical opinions online, Assassin's Creed has found a special place in my heart, and I am very excited for Shadows this week. (Haven't pre-ordered, won't until the March 18th reviews come in). I'm not blind to their flaws, but I want this post to be positive so I won't talk about those here. Just happy to have found this franchise and this community :)","153","post"
"nstav13","2025-03-20","[Assassin's Creed Shadows Playthrough Guide [Minor Spoilers]] Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a primarily non-linear game, which, like prior entries, has potential to make you feel overwhelmed, or do missions in an order that doesn’t always make the most sense. As a result, this guide is here to help you navigate your journey across Japan as Yasuke and Naoe. Huge shout out to Ubisoft for supplying review codes to make this possible. Please be aware that some minor spoilers are present, but no actual target or story spoilers will be revealed. 



Before we dive into the meat of the guide, please be aware of a few major things. First, there is no way currently to review which missions you’ve done. Missions are tracked in the objective board beneath targets, and once a target is dealt with, those missions disappear. As a result, this guide mentioned regions instead of specific missions. 



Secondly, there are 4 types of side missions. There are side missions to kill certain groups of targets; there are missions to collect X number of collectibles mostly from castles; there are missions to kill X amount of a certain enemy faction endemic to a region; and finally are cutscenes between Yasuke and Naoe. These cutscenes are not tracked in the mission objective board but will be mentioned in this guide. The 3 other types of side missions (collectibles, side targets, and bandit killings), I recommend trying to find as early as possible while exploring and completing the main missions in a region. Also as a note for exploration, many viewpoints are tied to castles. I recommend killing the Samurai in the castle to get rewarded with Mastery Points early on, but saving the unlocked chests which always contain legendary gear until you’re near max level, that way the gear doesn’t need to be upgraded for the end game. There’s plenty of epic and rare gear that outpaces Legendary Gear due to how rapidly you level up. 



Lastly in this preamble is player options. You have the choice between Guided and Exploration Mode. Guided mode disables achievements for using your scouts, while Exploration Mode will give you 3 pieces of information to find your objective. You can use scouts in the map menu to help find objectives more easily, and some side missions and hideout upgrades offer more scouts. Next, in you can play the game in Canon mode or with Choices Enabled. Our mod team did both, and I personally enjoyed Canon mode. While some dialogue choices were still present, it felt a lot more like a classic AC game if that’s what you want. You CANNOT change this after starting the game with this on or off. Then finally is the Immersive Language Settings. You can either play in your region’s language or have it set to always be Japanese or Portuguese. You choose this AFTER the opening cutscene and can be changed quickly after. English VA leaves much to be desired, but due to personal hearing issues and hardware, I found English more enjoyable than Immersive, despite really appreciating the idea of Immersive Mode. 



**THE GUIDE**



The game is split into a Prologue, 3 Acts, and an Epilogue. 



The prologue is very linear and lasts about 1-2 hours. After you gain control and the world starts to open up in Act 1, I highly suggest finding the Points of Interest with the orange meditation symbols. These are Kuji-Kiri and the first 4 you do unlock playable sections of content that take place during the Prologue. Act 1 lasts about 10 hours for most players it seems and ends with an obvious set piece. Please be aware that this set piece lasts for about an hour, with multiple very long cutscenes. Shortly after Act 2 opens, the entire world is open and you have a bunch of targets to go after. More importantly, in your hideout you’ll get a notification on the map to go speak with Yasuke or Naoe by the waterfall and sit by the fire. This is a nice cutscene mission, but we recommend waiting and not doing that immediately. 



Instead, first do the quests you can for potential League Members. These will each unlock as you complete main story assassinations and progress seasons. Do them as they pop up. 



After that, the next region you should go to is Omi. Two major assassinations have roots here, and more importantly, Yasuke’s personal quest takes you here. Before the assassinations, complete all of Yasuke’s personal quests, because that will unlock Naoe’s personal quest for Act 2, which I strongly encourage you to begin sooner rather than later. After this quest, do the campfire quest.



After you complete Omi, complete the quests you can in Iga, and then move to Harima. Once those are done, you’ll find some quests drawing you to Tamba, but I would encourage you to return to Omi to go to Wakasa. On the way to Wakasa through Omi is another cutscene Mission between Naoe and Yasuke. Wakasa has a decent enough main quest, but more importantly, unlocks the next important section of Yasuke’s story. Do that as soon as you can.

"Ubi-AssassinsCreed","2025-08-12",">The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of Assassin's Creed. With Shadows, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it's done on the main game, we scratched the surface with the Critical Role story drop, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.

"[deleted]","2025-03-23","I’m sorry for all the negativity that, apparently, seemed to dominate the past few months. Some of us are fans since the og ac. Hell I’m a fan since the Prince of Persia trilogy.

Thank you for this game. I’ve enjoyed most ac titles in the past. Shadows is a masterpiece, the world is truly next gen, the combat is the best of the entire series. And it was long ago a AC story captured me from beginning to end.

🙇 thank you for all the hard work while it seemed everyone was waiting for your downfall. The group of blindly hating people has gotten way too much space since social media. But don’t underestimate the group who just spend their lives with family and friends, watch the launch trailer and decide by then they gonna go buy it. And then notices the hate this game seemed to get since the first trailers.

Imagine your entire life is just about talking about the good old days. What a grandpa mentality. A good excuse for the people who just gave up on life and to hide behind the nostalgic rule “in the past everything was better. Let me now hate anything that’s new.” Yeah that’s a mentality that will make sure you live a positive life. Just support a game you like. And if you don’t like it, just don’t support it. Don’t put any energy in things you don’t like. Save yourself and other people who do love it, the time and energy. Move on and do something you do like.

Thank you again Ubisoft, for all these years of happy gaming. Exploring ancient worlds. Climbing iconic building and fighting evil. Can’t wait for DLC!","149","comment"

"ZazaB00","2025-03-03","Valhalla sold well, apparently, better than any AC before it.  You’d think that’s a sign the franchise is becoming more popular, but I think it’s mostly because there just aren’t many games you can be a Viking.  With that in mind, you’d think the longtime fan requested setting of Japan would also have gamers ready to jump in.  I’m just not sure on that.  

We’ve had a stellar experience in Ghost of Tsushima release, and it has a sequel coming out this year.  Rise of Ronin is another and it’s set to hit PC the same month.  These are games that just do the AC thing better than AC has for the last 8+ years.  Better combat, better stealth, and just better experiences.  AC has been successful because it was tackling time periods no one else had.  People were hungry for Egypt, Greece, and Vikings.  I just don’t think players will see Shadows as unique, but a shallow copy.  Maybe that’s enough.","138","comment"

"Animegamingnerd","2025-03-19","I am very curious to see where this lands sells wise. Ubisoft is putting it on so many platforms with it being on all the usual suspects of PS/Xbox/PC and additional versions on Mac & IOS and even a last minute verified on Steam Deck with it not only ditching Ubisoft launcher and their first launching day 1 on Steam in what feels like a decade. Not to mention the rumors of it being a Switch 2 launch title as well.

On one hand this as really great news, as virtually anyone can play AC Shadows, on the other it feels really desperate attempt in getting it into as many hands possible.

Reception at least so far while not the strongest for the series has had, been at least better than Star Wars & Avatar. But I do wonder what Ubisoft's internal projections are, because I feel like it will sell well, but the question will be is if its strong enough to meet Ubisoft's sales targets and most importantly are they gonna learn any lessons or are we gonna be back in 12 to 24 months hearing how they blew all of Shadow's profits on a huge flop?","132","comment"

"KataMod","2025-07-18","[New extensive interview with Fumito Ueda (Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, more) and Keita Takahashi (Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, more)!] From https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a -- translated to English below:

Keita Takahashi is a game designer best known for directing Katamari Damacy. 

Since then he has produced a string of distinctive titles such as Noby Noby Boy and Wattam.

I (the writer) have long respected Takahashi-san. Back at the 2005 Game Developers Conference in the United States, his closing line left a deep impression on me: “We don’t make games for shareholders. Don’t let yourself be shackled—be freer.”

A video game is undeniably a commercial product, yet it’s also an interactive medium through which strong authorial voices can shine. Personally, I gravitate toward one-of-a-kind works—experiences that provoke emotional shakes I’ve never felt before. That’s why Takahashi’s games are my favorites. After playing his newest title to a T through to the end, I felt he was again “taking on emotions only video games can express.”

I admit that’s a vague explanation; to a T is remarkably hard to put into words. While wondering how on earth to convey its appeal, I heard that Takahashi was returning to Japan from his home in San Francisco. An interview seemed the ideal opportunity—but what should I ask? Then came a stroke of luck: Fumito Ueda, the game designer behind ICO and Shadow of the Colossus and a long-time friend of Takahashi, agreed to join as a co-interviewee.

Below you’ll find their wide-ranging discussion of to a T as well as today’s—and tomorrow’s—video-game landscape. Enjoy.

Text / Interview / Editing: Keigo Toyoda Photos: Takamitsu Wada

***


#1. Perhaps We’re Past the Era of “New Mechanics”

Interviewer: Thank you both for your time today. To dive right in, I find to a T extremely difficult to talk about—a game that resists being put into words. I worry that any theme I choose may miss the point. So, I’m grateful Ueda-san could join us.

Fumito Ueda (hereafter Ueda): Pleasure to be here.

Interviewer: to a T seems to test the player’s sensibilities. How has it been received overseas? I assumed the concept might resonate more easily outside Japan.

Keita Takahashi (hereafter Takahashi): I thought so too, but many people still cling to notions of “what a game ought to be,” so I haven’t looked at reviews much. But when I peek at social media, those who played say “It’s fun” and “Love it,” which makes me happy.

Ueda: That doesn’t mean the ratings are bad, right? What about Steam reviews?

Takahashi: They’re “Very Positive,” but there aren’t many of them—feels like hardly anyone’s heard of the game. We really have to spread the word. Honestly, I never expected Ueda-san to like to a T so much! (laughs)

Ueda: (laughs)

#How They Met

Interviewer: When did your friendship begin?

Ueda: We first met at GDC 2003 in San Jose, shortly after Katamari Damacy’s release. There was a booth showcasing several games; we bumped into each other there. Japanese attendees were rare back then, so a small community formed quickly.

Takahashi: I knew of Ueda-san because right before starting Katamari, my boss told me, “Play current, proper games to understand boxed-product scope.” Two of the titles I played were ICO and Cubivore (Dōbutsu Banchō). Those left a mark.

#Ueda’s First Impressions of to a T

Interviewer: Ueda-san, what struck you when you played to a T?

Ueda: It isn’t mechanics-driven; it’s story-driven. (turning to Takahashi) Is that the direction you preferred?

Takahashi: When we released the first trailer, you asked, “So what’s the gameplay?” I replied, “No particularly special mechanics,” and you said, “Good.” I figured, “Ah, this is a veteran’s perspective.” (laughs)

Ueda: I probably said that because I felt we’re no longer in an age that demands brand-new mechanics every time. New devices, new mechanics—maybe that era is over.

Takahashi: You’ve said that since Journey (Flowery Journey in Japan).

Ueda: Even without original mechanics, you can hone the feel or the art. Whether people like it is another question, but sharpening existing mechanics can be better. As for to a T, the volume felt “just right.” Story, mini-games—you’re not forced to clear the mini-games. That looseness felt fresh to me. Honestly, I seldom finish games these days, but I played this straight through.

Takahashi: Such praise! Who needs lots of Steam reviews when I have Ueda-san’s approval? (laughs)

#Visual Style

Ueda: A tiny detail I loved: you don’t use translucency. No alpha blending, and shadows are done with halftone. Even though Unreal Engine can do photorealism, you removed all that. You aimed for a new stylized look.

Takahashi: I considered a toon-shader outline, but it never quite clicked—performance burdens, camera angles failing—so halftone felt right.

Ueda: That was the better choice. Outlines would have pushed it toward anime pastiche.

Takahashi: Exactly.

"Wyvern39","2025-07-04","[I really wish Spider-Man (2018) wasn’t so dull] Just bought a PS5 this year with Spiderman Miles Morales ultimate edition which came with spiderman remastered. Good value, except for Peter’s face but we’ll get to that. 

Right off the bat, the game looks…pretty good. Nothing mind blowing but pretty. Not as good as something like Ghost of Tsushima or Red Dead 2 but still quite nice. I also like the voice acting. We’ve got my boy Sasuke (Yuri Lowenthal) voicing Spider-Man and he’s pitch perfect. He brings just the right amount of sarcastic but earnest charm that’s hard not to root for. Unfortunately that’s where the compliments end. Wait, also the load times are pretty fast. 

We’ll start with nitpicks. I wish there was a way to disable the music when you’re swinging. I got sick of the same generic horn-heavy piece kicking in as soon as I started swinging for more than 5 seconds. The music in general is nothing special. There’s parts where it almost sounds like the Raimi films but legally distinct enough to avoid issues. Unfortunately that makes it very dull and having to hear it constantly became particularly grating. Maybe I missed the option to turn it off so if there is a way please let me know. 

Second nitpick: I’m not a fan of Peter’s face. I thought I would get used to it and it’s probably just bias since I’ve seen reviews and gameplay clips with the old face which seemed to fit much better but either way, it’s just off. I don’t like the way he emotes or looks. No offence to the mo-cap model. 

Now a major issue: I can’t really stand the combat. I think my biggest issue with it is the fact that I never feel like I’m fully controlling where Peter is going during a fight. He does all these flips and zips but I can never shake the sensation that I’m guiding him more than controlling. To compare it to the Arkham games which this obviously took heavy inspiration from, there were exceedingly few scenarios in that entire franchise in which I didn’t know what Batman would do at any given time while facing baddies. I, more often than not, knew that if I moved the stick in a certain direction, that’s where Batman would go. In Spider-Man for contrast, I find myself frustrated a lot more about the direction spidey picks, usually leading to more damage. There’s every possibility I’m just bad at the combat but considering I can beat every Arkham game at the highest new-game+ difficulty, you’d think there’d be some transferable skills. But the biggest Achilles heel with the combat is the fact that it’s never that fun. Even when I finish an encounter taking no damage and with the highest possible combo, there’s never much satisfaction. The way spidey punches, moves and shoots webs just never feels that good. There’s a crunchiness to the combat in the Arkham games even going as far back as Asylum that Spider-Man is just missing for me. I’m not knowledgeable enough in game design to explain exactly why that is but it’s likely a combination of a lack of control, not-great sound design and maybe the lack of much mechanical depth. Again, I could just be missing things and not taking full advantage of all the combat opportunities the game has to offer, but this is a game that even kids can play and supposedly have fun with while engaging with on a purely surface level; I’m trying to get combos, I’m trying to use my gadgets and I’m dodging things pretty often but none of it feels that good. 

As an addendum to the combat section, the stealth so far has been cheeks. Admittedly I’m only about 6-7 hours in the game so it could improve but it’s been fairly mediocre so far. The same basic ‘make noise, lure guard, take him out from the shadows’ business as usual. The basics are the same as every other action game with stealth components but thus far it hasn’t done much beyond the basics. Again, compared to Arkham, there’s just seemingly not a lot of depth to the system. In those games, you had a large open environment that allowed you to plan your approach and descend when the time is right. As with combat, the Arkham games just made me feel like I had far more control over the situation when it came to slinking around the shadows. You can argue that getting better gadgets will create more variation but just the basic moment-to-moment stealth isn’t interesting in the slightest so I’m not sure how adding bloat to an underbaked mechanic will make it more engaging. Part of the issue in these early hours has been the environments. The indoor areas, like the museum, aren’t that large and thus don’t feel conducive to proper emergent situations or gameplay. The guards are brain dead and seemingly no matter how many you take out, as long as they don’t hear you they don’t really react. One of the genius elements of the Batman games was that guards talked to each other so if one guard wasn’t responding because you knocked him out, the others would go on high alert. There was a dynamism to those scenarios that’s missing in Spider-Man.

"theSlex","2025-01-06","[The 79 patient games I completed on my Steam Deck in 2024] I grew up PC gaming and had my first child in 2019, severely impacting my free time. After a few years of basically no videogaming I took the plunge on a Steam Deck in early 2023 and it's completely reignited my love for the hobby.

Here are the patient games I completed in 2024, all entirely in handheld mode on my Deck, as well as write-ups for the titles I considered ""very fun"" and ""all-time favorites"".

**Hollow Knight** (10/10) - The game that launched Metroidvanias into the stratosphere is, nearly eight years later, still the pinnacle of the genre.

The art, the precision controls and platforming, the varying regions and enemies. Enough atmosphere and story to draw you in but never so much as to distract from the gameplay. A reasonable difficulty to the core game and an assortment of difficult challenges awaiting those who seek them.

I could replay this game endlessly, which may be the highest praise I could give a game.

**Life is Strange** (9/10) - If you are into narrative heavy games and/or choose your own adventure titles Life is Strange is a must play.

The plot is legit Hollywood caliber and the voice acting is flat out flawless. The story offers countless twists and turns, smart foreshadowing and callbacks, and - remarkably - it truly feels like your choices matter to the narrative, both in the small details and the overall tale.

**Prey \[2017\]** (8/10) - Prey is the first AAA title in ages that really pulled me in. I was fully engaged for the 32 hours it took to roll credits.

Many games claim to let you ""play your way"", but Prey actually pulls it off. Most puzzles can be solved in a variety of ways, and I found myself tweaking my build throughout the game to thread the narrative needle. The story is outstanding and the game runs and controls like a dream on the Steam Deck using the sticks and gyro controls. As an old school CS vet, I'd never have imagined I'd enjoy a PC FPS without using a mouse and keyboard, but here we are.

I look forward to picking up the Mooncrash DLC and completing a second playthrough with a very different build of Morgan.

**Strange Horticulture** (8/10) - Strange Horticulture is an excellent deduction/puzzle game set in a \~19th century quazi-English world with heavy occult vibes.

The game is incredibly polished, layering on additional features and tools that play off each other and lead to a variety of interesting puzzles. Solving mysteries regularly makes you feel clever and accomplished and the story that plays out is well-crafted.

The game felt very liner until, in the final hour, it dawned on me that my endgame decisions were going to impact the way to story concluded. At that point I misclicked a location which locked me into a story decision I didn't want to make. It wasn't the end of the world, but it was a tad frustrating to have a 10 hour narrative game end in this way.

This minor gripe aside, if you've enjoyed games like Return of the Obra Dinn or The Case of the Golden Idol you'll adore Strange Horticulture.

**Chants of Sennaar** (8/10) - The core puzzles are original and creative. The world becomes more vibrant as you play and a surprisingly competent story unfolds throughout. The puzzles required for the ""good"" ending get a little tedious but that's a slight blemish on an otherwise stellar game.

**Jusant** (8/10) - The developers laser-focused on a handful of compelling gameplay mechanics, capturing the mechanical feel of mountain climbing without making the \~6 hour game feel like a chore. This is the exact opposite of the $70 open-world bloat that AAA companies serve up year after year.

The visual style is vibrant and fun, there's a heavy amount of (optional) environmental storytelling, and the sound design is phenomenal.

If a focused, chill adventure game with memorable controls and breathtaking vistas sounds appealing to you, look no further than Jusant.

**Hi-Fi RUSH** (8/10) - Brilliant in so many ways: the vibrant visual style that transitions seamlessly from cinematic to gameplay, a fantastic score that blends commercial hits with fitting original tunes, and engaging combat that shuns button-mashing for a wide variety of well-timed combos.

This is gaming fun in its purest form.

**The Talos Principle** (8/10) - Blends interesting first-person puzzles with a fascinating story that is drip-fed to the player as they interact with the world around them.

The puzzles remain interesting for most of the game, though it felt like the devs could have trimmed the title down from the \~20 hours it takes to complete to a tighter \~15 and delivered a better product, but the world building and mysteries kept me eagerly coming back.

It's the rare game that will make you question your place in the universe and I'll be thinking about this title and the questions it posits for some time.

**Death's Door** (8/10) - An isometric Zelda-like with an amazing soundtrack and engaging gameplay. Dialo","120","post"

However, Shadows suffers from the exact reason I expected it to - being able to tackle any mission in any order hurts the story telling. You can't really write character arcs if you can't predict how the player will approach the missions.

The stealth is the best the series has ever had and reminds me of more old school stealth systems in some places, and the combat is serviceable enough. But the out of order narrative really hurt my motivation to complete the game. Maybe I'll get back to it at a later date.","116","comment"

"ihavefaith77","2025-08-09","[Assassins Creed: Mirage. A tale of disappointment] Alright, I wanna preface this with saying I know AC Mirage isn't that old, but it got added to gamepass so I figured I'd give it a try, as it and Shadows are the only Assassins Creed titles I've passed on so far. I'll start with positives, and apologies to fans of this game, continue to the boatload of cons.

Pros:
- There is a tighter window in the parry system, which I enjoy immensely as I thought previous titles were way too forgiving.
- A more streamlined experience than the last 3 titles, which I enjoy as I found that while Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla were fun, they way overstayed their welcomes when it came to length.
Okay that's it for pros and here we go.

Cons:
- Stiffest game to date, from animations to cutscenes to parkour to AI to mounts and everything else, game is stiff as a board.
- Story? Yeah whatever, here's William Miles talking to you for whatever reason in the openeing cutscene. Just go with it.
- Laziness and lack of polish. Within the first 4 lines of the opening cutscene, I found 2 instances where dialogue on screen and words being spoken didn't match up. No biggie on it's own, but it screams lack of polish from a ""renowned AAA developer"" where they can't even match subtitles to script.
- Basim feels like controlling a tank. You thought Eivor was slow and clunky? Lmao Basim sprints slower than I did in grade 7 and turns like his ankles are always sprained.
- Useless skill tree, with abilities introduced within the first 3 hours of gameplay that trivialise the rest of the game.
- Dialogue. On top of average writing and zero story, characters NEVER STOP TALKING, SHUT THE FUCK UP SO I CAN PLAY THE GAME, IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO GO AND STAB THIS DUDE IN THE NECK ANYWAYS.

There is genuinely so much more I could say but unlike AC Mirage, I won't burden you with more that you don't wanna hear. 4/10, with this being easily one of the weakest entries in the series. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.","114","post"
"AbundlaSticks","2025-03-30","Odyssey was their big one in my opinion. In terms of actually having fun with a video game, there’s no other AC I’ve had more fun with than Odyssey. It’s not about whether it’s a good AC or not, it’s just a damn fun game. The great cast of characters, the absolutely gorgeous world filled with fun side quests/stories, and variety in how you can build your Misthios, variety in the combat, the ship battles are the best they’ve ever been, boarding was always epic. Kassandra is also the best main protagonist they’ve made. She has a great sense of humor, she’s tough when she needs to be but still allows herself to be vulnerable. 

I’ve played 20 or so hours of Shadows and yeah, it’s definitely a step up from Valhalla, it’s just not as FUN as odyssey.","110","comment"
"That_Guy_On_Redditt","2025-03-29","Those are just a handful though. They don't really represent all side quests. The kuji-kiri quests, Naoe and Yasuke personal quests, companion quests and most of the assassination wheels can also be considered side quests. Also, the exclamation marks on the map aren't all collectathons. Some of them have actual story quests or just interesting cutscenes. I agree those 'kill x amount' quests are annoying, but I've just been ignoring them.

Personally, I prefer the structure of Shadows' side content over Origins and Valhalla, though I think Odyssey is better in this regard. Odyssey had so many side quests littered around the world and I wish Shadows had more of that, but Shadows mostly focuses on the chart to get side quests. Still, Shadows has a crazy amount of quests to do when that chart opens up.","109","comment"
"gameservatory","2025-09-17","I wonder if some of this is because the creatives working on AC's plot don't really get why these aspects are compelling. The whole sci-fi frame helps to draw parallels to human behavior across ages of history; the Isu are a useful abstraction for exploring various religions, cults, conspiracies, and the power these beliefs vest in authority figures. Darby McDevitt is the only writer at Ubi in recent memory who still seems to use the entirety of AC's mythology to its full potential. Hoping Hexe knocks it out of the park.

That said, I don't think every AC game has to focus on all of its aspects. Games heavier in one or some of the parallel plots are fine if the story told is interesting. I think Mirage was a solid entry, for example; it knew better than to dabble in the modern day plot because the project wasn't budgeted to pay off Basim's setup at the end of Valhalla. But here comes Shadows rebooting the modern day plot again by omission. Granted, it's also so light on details, there's a way for it to wind back to the lingering threads left from Valhalla. Just seems like a giant missed opportunity for a 70+ hour mainline game to have so little to say on AC's overarching narrative. The latest rift mission was pretty neat though... I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.","109","comment"
"Kristovanoha","2025-03-03","I mean based on the last previews you pretty much can't stealth as yasuke. His parkour is limited compared to naoe (can't even climb the synchronization points) and he has only ""brutal assassination"" which is super loud and basically reveals you to every nearby enemy.

So far the only ""stealthy"" way to play him seems to be to focus on the bow and ""snipe"" people.

Pretty weird that they would completely rework the stealth system, and one of the playable characters can't interact with most of it.

For example sound and darkness are more important now. There is separate stealth difficulty slider with much better enemy ai on the higher difficulties. Seasons affect environment i.e. in winter ponds get frozen so you can't swim/dive. During fall leaves fall off of trees and bushes so you can't hide in them. Rain muffles sound so you can be much louder without being revealed.","106","comment"
"LacidOnex","2025-05-13","I put a lot of hours in, so here's the good and the bad of it. Looking back I'd say 50-60 is a more realistic price, 70 is steep for so much copy paste.

GOOD -

It's new AC. The combat is better and less RPGey, feels more like the original AC but you can't just parry infinitely while enemies wait their turn. Yasuke unlocks late (about ten hours unless you beeline the main story), and allows you to take on enemies several levels higher in open combat. Naoe cannot openly fight more than a few enemies without the right practice and skills.

The historical locations are neat. I loved the ezio series for all the cool real locations. This is NOT that. The towns feel a little more lively when they are based on real things - like ""this town was known for soy sauce making"" and it's just a town with a generic warehouse. Other copy paste towns to fill gaps do not offer the same ""running across rooftops"" feeling. I'd say it's about 50/50.

The weapons are pretty fun. It's one step above Skyrim combat on the surface, you just kinda throw heavy or light and have two executions that repeat over and over and over when you kill the last dude. You can absolutely mix up the combat and learn a more involved way to use perks, but it doesn't FEEL worth it outside of boss fights. In bigger fights with Naoe, you often throw 2/4 lights in the chain, and then need to wait for a parry or you get slapped. Long, flowing, mix up intense combat is doable during boss encounters.

The NPCs are likeable - Junjiro is a little shit but I love that tanuki shaped fucker. I stopped skipping cutscenes after a while.

ITS JAPAN DUDE WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR 2 DECADES

BAD -

Copy paste towers, no climbing puzzles. With the exception of 3 locations I've found, there's very little ""whoa that's the coliseum!"". Most castles are the exact same over and over but that's still fun. Climbing puzzle zones are watered down and covered in paint to mark the way. Himeji better be sick when I get there.

Mini games get repetitive - you have Horse Archery, Mini Bosses, 2 different versions of quick time hell, a ""sneak up close to wildlife"" and zones where they either hid a few collectibles or hid a few zones you have to pray at, which comes with a very slow animation of clapping.

Missions are 90% walk over here, find the town put here just for this mission, grab the thing, and fast travel back. I find exploring way more fun and just doing whatever mission I bump into. Most assassinations require 3 or 4 boring missions leading up to ""tracking down"" a target.

Speaking of exploring - the fuckers don't give you markers for quests. Do you love the Japanese language? You better, because every single mission must be DISCOVERED. Some random dude is like ""oh go find my mortal enemy, he's in Okugawa province near Shabririnogud, in winter."" Also if you fast travel the season might change for some reason so fuck you. This can be turned off but says it will lock achievements.

Seasons are cool, but more trouble than it's worth. You can skip a season, but sometimes it happens against your will, which sucks if the mission only occurs seasonally (very rare). My Naoe is in her mid 80s at this point based on the number of winters.

Winter means you can't just wander in a random direction, you HAVE to follow the road or you move super slow. The starting area is also super thick foliage, which stops you from just running wild.

The hyped up base building is garbage. You don't use your base except to upgrade weapons, and the interiors of EVERY building in every town is just this empty ass room. It's like nobody in Japan owns a table.

Enemies have a ton of variety that doesn't actually impact the game. Ezio fought heavies, swordsmen, pikemen, officers, and ranged units, and they all felt unique. In this game it's just ""wait for the parry indicator"" unless it's a heavy, then you dodge.

Gear is... Bad. I found early on that certain legendary perks were incredibly broken, making all other gear useless. Things like ""after a crit, your next attack is a crit too"" or ""can parry un-parryable attacks"" are too OP, and ignoring them, gear stats is bland and unengaging when you're ultimately just choosing the highest level weapon you have.","105","comment"
"Kinda_relevent","2025-09-28","[Finishing AC Shadows - My Experience] I feel nothing. Finishing the DLC, the last 2 boss fights I just said fuck it and put the difficulty from expert to story. It’s sad that a game that used to be so rich in character, morality, cool sci-fi, etc has distilled to this. I keep to the opinion that assassins creed must have the assassination confessional scenes for every reason you could possibly think of. It’s better across the board. The way I explained the RPG’s to my friend is that it’s like going from bungie halo campaign to destiny campaign in terms of style, quality, etc.

I will say that’s it’s probably got the best combat in the series. The stealth was good, wouldn’t say it’s the best. The environments made it feel bland to me.

I feel like I may have not experienced the game the same as others. I never used the team mate mechanic, never had to engrave/upgrade equipment, I oddly never stabbed a guy through the wall, never snorkeled my way to an assassination, never really used the throwing items, didn’t really perry attacks I just dodged… on expert it’s safer to disengage then get unlucky.

I feel like the game across-the-board didn’t present me with the mechanics and opportunities in order to engage with it’s systems. It could also be that I tend to want to assassinate only using my hidden blade and like elimination based stuff instead of ghosting through places.","105","post"
"StunLT","2025-07-18","Is that really surprising? Football will always be popular and the core gameplay works and it's fun to play. Sports games will always have their fan base plus there's always new young people who want to play those games.

But speaking about Assassin's Creed Shadows it's also not surprising. The major critique of this game is that the  story arc may be fine on its own, but the writing is not that good and the side quests are forgettable, but the other parts of the game are fantastic and the game is very fun to play and explore which are the most important parts of the game. The gameplay itself. 

People forget that if you take out Rockstar out of this discussion there aren't many developers who can achieve this kinda world development and make it so engaging and fun to explore, and realistic.  And Ubisoft is one of those developers. 

Ubisoft has its problems mainly in the writing department and their quest design, but the core gameplay is always solid, and there are plenty of people who like their gameplay.

People forget that these days games are a little bit like cars. Just because you don't like that car it doesn't mean it doesn't work for other people.","105","comment"
"Ubi-RealDude","2024-12-11",">You can recruit few specific characters that will become your Ally. Those characters have a specific story, quest and abilities. You can pick one or two of them to assist you in Combat or Stealth, depending on their abilities; some are fighters, some are more shinobi type of characters, so you can decide to complement your character or reinforce their strength. Personally, I like using Stealth ally with Yasuke to add more Stealth options!

"ImmortalThunderGod79","2025-04-04","EXACTLY its genuinely perfect

They really took advantage of the strengths of having Yasuke and Naoe as the dual protagonist - we got to see a balanced nuanced perspective of Oda Nobunaga as he was in history from their eyes... 

A man with ambition who will ruthlessnessly crush anyone who stands in his way of unifying Japan for peace - a flawed man, but not a complete heartless monster as he is also compassionate and fair as we seen with his friendships with Yasuke and Luis Frois, his enduring bond with Mori Ranmaru and how historical records like the Shinchō Kōki (Chronicles of Nobunaga) + Historia De Japam (History of Japan) made note of how he treated his retainers, servants, peasants, commoners and nobles with upmost kindess and respect... So to see all those sides of Nobunaga in Shadows made me happy... 

I feel confident in saying Assassin's Creed's depiction of Oda Nobunaga is right up there with the franchise's depictions of Leonardo Da Vinci, George Washington and Blackbeard as being great imo...","101","comment"
"ACoderGirl","2025-09-15","Yeah, I think the big issue with the plot comes down to three points:

1. They spread the main plot way too thin by having so many independent Shinbakufu members to hunt down. By making it non-linear, they weakened the story, since the game cannot assume you've seen most others.

2. The majority of side quests are just ""assassinate these 4-8 people who are spread super far out and have minimal story"". Such side quests don't really add to the story and just feel akin to a fetch quest.

3. They omitted or skimped on many of the classic AC elements. The Templar missions are great, but their involvement is very small. The Assassin's aren't even named for much of the game, instead confusingly calling them something else that I can't even remember the name of. Their connection to the overall plot for the Assassins is limited. The Isu practically doesn't exist. They've almost abandoned the modern day story, being limited to a few cryptic words of a computer program (?) speaking to the nameless modern day protagonist. I dunno what the writers were smoking, as I cannot relate at all to the decisions they've made.

Naoe and Yasuke are great characters, but that isn't enough to salvage the writing. It's like the writers wrote up some great characters and then called it a day, forgetting that they also needed great quests, worldbuilding, and series tie ins.","99","comment"

I don't own Ubisoft stocks and I don't know a single person who works on these games.

People are growing tired of their endless bitching and moaning - it's *every* release at this point, there's *always* something wrong. Just stop already and find a different hobby. It's miserable.

"kalirion","2024-12-25","[My own very brief reviews of the games I patiently finished in 2024] Since everyone seems to be doing these again, I decided to jump on the bandwagon. Since I game on an i7-920 w/1050ti, the titles I play tend to be ""patient"" by default, but I had to remove one new indie release to keep this post in.   And then I had to remove mention of a certain remaster as well and just keep the games it remastered, so this is now Take 3.

These reviews and ratings are, of course, extremely subjective, but feel free to slam me in the comments if I rate your childhood favorite badly :)

[Edit: Just finished Sheepo, so adding it to the list] [Edit 2: Finished TimeShifters last night]

**Outlaws + A Handful of Missions** (1997) - I can see why this game is considered a classic, it has great atmosphere and just feels really good to play, once the technical difficulties or running it well are worked out (I used dgVoodoo2 and set the game to render with d3d), and the cutscenes moving the story forward are fantastic.   Pretty hard though, I ended up using plenty manual saves in some places. My GOTY. 9/10

**Afterimage** (2023) - A very good and very huge Metroidvania. At 60 hours this was my most played *single* (i.e. not collection / pack) game on Steam this year, and I still only got 37/46 achievements. 8.5/10

**Islets** (2022) - A very enjoyable and comfy Metroidvania. The feel (though not the gameplay) reminded me of Yoku's Island Express. 8/10

**Astalon: Tears of the Earth** (2021) - A fun metroidvania with a nice ""character swap mechanic"". Some people may find being sent to the beginning of the dungeon after death annoying, but I didn't mind it much in this case, made unlocking the shortcusts (mostly elevator access) all the more important. I ended up beating all the additional game modes EXCEPT for the rougelikelike Boss Rush because screw that one. 8/10

**Doom classic series** (1993-2023) - What can I say, it's a classic. I played Doom 1 + 2 + official expansions/wads + Doom Zero wad.  Doom 1  + 2 + Final Doom expansions were replays, everything else was new to me. Some of the parts are much worse than the rest of course, overall I'd personally rate them in the order: Doom (8.5/10) > Doom II = No Rest for the Living = Sigil = Sigil 2 = Doom Zero  (8/10) >>>> TNT Evilution (6.5/10) > Plutonia Experiment (6/10) > Master Levels for Doom II  (5/10). 8/10

**Down the Rabbit Hole** (2020) - A very cute VR diorama adventure game. As a 2D game it would've been maybe a 7/10, but the VR aspect just added so much, with you being able to grab the diorama ""by the roots"" to move it and look around inside it ... It's just hard to explain.  100%d this one, though it took some googling to find a couple of the collectibles required for that. 8/10

**Xanthiom Zero** (2023) - A very good metroidvania with highly customizable equipment loadout options which greatly change the gameplay. I managed to 100% this one, though I needed a lot of luck and cheesing to make it through the ""all modifiers"" run. 8/10

**The Citadel** (2020) - A rather fun boomer shooter. Didn't get the story one bit. 7.5/10

**Elderand** (2023) - An enjoyable metroidvania with a variety of upgradable weapons, some of which give access to special attacks you execute by fighting game-style input combinations. 7.5/10

**Vomitoreum** (2021) - A neat FPS metroidvania utilizing the GZ Doom engine.  Has a gritty atmosphere and a very dark story I really didn't understand. 7.5/10

**Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs** (2019) - The great amount of fun making pigs go poof by slingshotting them with birds in VR was lessened by the seemingly arbitrary at times physics that everythign is based around. 7.5/10

**Moto Racer 2** (1998) - An very fun racing game, though I hated how the dirt bike tracks had all the tiny jumps which would kill my momentum while the AI opponents had no such issues. Maybe I just didn't know how to manage them? Anyway, I beat all Championships in Arcade mode, as Simulation was too much for me.  7.5/10

**Half-Life + Opposing Force + Blue Shift** (1998-2001) - This is the only item the list where the whole thing was a ""replay"" for me - 3rd time playing the main game, 2nd time for both expansions. This is good stuff, but honestly I've never been as crazy about Half-Life 1 as most of the FPS gaming community was, even back when it was released (well, my first time playing it was a couple years after release, but close enough.) 7.5/10

**I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream** (1995) - Fantastic story telling and atmosphere, but I'll admit I didn't really care too much for the puzzle structure. Still, the former makes this title a recommended experience. 7.5/10

**Medal of Honor: Allied Assault + Spearhead + Breakthrough** (2002-2003) - The original cinematic WW2 first person shooter, on PC at least? You can still tell this was a AAA title. After near wearing out the quicksave/quickload keys on OG campaign on Hard difficulty, I realized that the perfect way for me to ","98","post"

\>Let’s be honest: we might have been concerned about such a late hands-on session with Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Even though we tried a “work in progress” version of Ubisoft’s upcoming game, it was clear that the lengthy delay—and the polishing still underway—has been beneficial. That said, there are still some lingering uncertainties about this installment, even if our experience during the few hours we spent with it was largely positive.

\>Yes, the Ubisoft Québec team has brought some fresh ideas to add depth to the gameplay (the two types of characters, the variety of weapons, the mastery trees, and gear-related abilities), as well as to the core pillars of the series. However, it feels like the fundamentals haven’t been drastically altered. After five, maybe six hours of play, we felt we’d already grasped the contours of certain repetitive gameplay loops: exploring sanctuaries to clear out hostile occupants, gather resources, and claim the contents of various chests; infiltrating enemy-filled castles—where foes aren’t always easy to spot!—to earn more prestigious rewards; and ticking off quest objectives.

\>While the structure and design of the open world in this installment are commendable, there’s a slight sense of déjà vu in the over-reliance on scouring areas with a fine-tooth comb. Did we get a complete picture of what the game has to offer, or will more surprises await us in the final review? Of course, there’s the story—which was barely revealed during our session—that fans of the series and lore enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating. However, we worry about how these repetitive gameplay loops might impact the excitement between the start and end of the experience. If most of the game’s length is built on familiar mechanics, the wonder of AC Shadows might only last so long for part of its audience…","93","comment"

"Ubi-RealDude","2024-12-12","From u/nstav13: [I won't be able to make it, so: It seems like most of the story takes place from about 1581-1584. Can you explain the decision-making process around telling a story in a tighter time period rather than exploring more of the setting? If it was based around telling a more personal character story, what are you doing differently from other non-linear entries that have brought character progress to a standstill to fulfill the open nature of the game's structure?](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hacjz1/comment/m17ld1v/)

>This is a very interesting question.  If you look at AC Odyssey for example, it does go through a chronological series of events and tells the story of that world through the POV of Kassandra/Alexios. Even though the world is open, the story of the protagonist progresses through history in a relatively linear fashion.  I guess Shadows follows a similar structure, where the game starts in 1579 and moves forward through the historical timeline, but tells the story from two different perspectives, so you can expect certain portions of the story to play memories in different order.  I really think players will appreciate some of the depth that flashbacks and memories will give to the world and characters.

"eccentricbananaman","2025-03-23","Very true. I mean after all, it's Assassin's Creed. I've never played the games, but wasn't one of the main plot threads about ancient aliens who shaped the history of humanity and created powerful artifacts that are the series' macguffins? Also Benjamin Franklin or Michelangelo being allied with the assassins. I feel like ""realism"" and ""historical accuracy"" kinda flew out the window early on. 

I feel like literally the ONLY reasonable logical complaint about Yasuke's inclusion is that for a STEALTH game, having a large black samurai walking around in feudal Japan is pretty antithetical to the concept of stealth. Like even now in modern Tokyo, as a white dude I was getting a ton of people staring at me the last time I visited Japan. I was not very inconspicuous. All that said however, it's a videogame. Nothing matters as long as it's fun. Who cares if the game has a black guy for a protagonist?","87","comment"
"Zehnpae","2025-03-25","[Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly] GemCraft: Chasing Shadows is a tower defense game developed by Game in a Bottle.  Released in 2015, GemCraft is what happens when a flash game you played in your college library 20 years ago just refuses to die and keeps iterating.

We play as one of the last surviving mages after the accidental summoning of a powerful shadow Demoness. It is up to us to try to imprison her with brightly colored sparklies.

Gameplay involves creating clever mazes with towers, traps and magical gems, then doing it all over again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And...

---

**The Good**

This is pretty much everything you could want in a tower defense game. Mazing, interesting tower combinations, fun power creep, balancing economy against enemy strength, etc... The only thing keeping this back from being a contender for best tower defense game is all the rule34 artists are busy working on Bloons TD6.

There's a bunch of small things that add to the charm. You get a whole game when you buy it, no mobile transaction nonsense that normally plagues the TD industry. Secrets to figure out. A huge achievement system that requires outside the box thinking.  It even has a story!  Not much of one but hey...progress!

---

**The Bad**

The back half/high end is a bit samey. You can win almost every map by building one tower and boosting the ever living bajeezus out of it. Maps also tend to narrow out removing a lot of your need to even make mazes which was half the fun. The strategy and thought that went into the early game makes way for ""Yellow/red/white gem go brrrrr.""

---

**The Ugly**

If you played any other GemCraft games you'll recognize about half the levels. There's an in game lore reason for it but this much repetition between games gives me Madden NFL whiplash. I'm not exactly here for the amazing art direction though so it's a forgivable sin.

---

**Final Thoughts**

The GemCraft series is one of the cornerstones of the tower defense genre. The early game is a hoot. It has that old flash games vibe that anybody who was online in the 2000's will adore. The otherwise lackluster late game if somewhat offset by the fun of achievement hunting. It's a fun way to kill a few hours.

---

**Interesting Game Facts**

The help page for GemCraft includes instructions on how to port your game saves from Widnows 2000 to Mac OSX. It's like looking at a time capsule.  I wonder if I should email the dev and let them know their link to Adobe Flashplayer no longer works...

"That_Guy_On_Redditt","2025-09-20","[Thank You Ubisoft Bordeaux!!! (Claws of Awaji Thoughts) [Spoilers]] AC Shadows is an amazing game to be sure. I played it for about 260 hours now, but the game always had a TON of issues holding it back from greatness. Some problems the game always had (in short):

* A terribly paced story (Especially after act 1)
* Completely soulless side quests for the most part in the form of endless target wheels and random 'kill 100 x' type quests.
* Poor implementation of the dual protagonist system (Never working together in gameplay, and forcing them into cutscenes whenever convenient)
* No real relationship building between Naoe and Yasuke besides a couple of short scenes.
* Extremely awkward dialogue and poor writing overshadow the good moments in the story.
* Boss battles that were laughably bad, easy, and instantly forgettable.
* A world that felt beautiful but empty and devoid of anything to do.
* A borderline insulting ending and an incomplete main story.

Despite all Shadows' strengths, like stealth, combat, parkour, graphics, seasons, etc etc (This game has a lot of strengths), other aspects still felt leagues behind what they should be.

**ENTER CLAWS OF AWAJI**

In my humble opinion, Claws of Awaji is a remarkable improvement on the base game, fixing almost every criticism above. So here's what I think about Claws of Awaji (I tried to keep it spoiler-free, but put the spoiler tag just in case).

**THE STORY AND WRITING**

Claws of Awaji's story is fantastic from start to finish. It feels more personal to both main characters, and unlike most of the base game, the story carries a continuous intensity. The pacing is top-notch, almost never slowing down. Unlike the base game, which overwhelmed us with target wheels with barely any story or personality, there are very few targets in Claws of Awaji, but they are far more fleshed out and exciting. Naoe and Yasuke are placed in real peril, allowing them to bond much more as friends and allies. The DLC also has better villains than anyone in the base game, and takes the time to hype up the fights where you finally clash with them. This results in a far more engaging story than the soulless checklist Shinbakufu from the base game.

I also need to mention the cutscenes. The cutscenes in the expansion are consistently of a higher quality than those in the base game. There are many more fully motion-captured cutscenes, and even the more generic ones between two characters are better because of the new update, which gives us the option of 60fps in cutscenes. The DLC feels much more cinematic overall.

**THE SIDEQUESTS**

In the base game, Shadows flooded us with target wheels that had very little story behind them. They aren't bad by themselves, per se, but the amount of them, the level gating, and the way the targets were dispersed all across Japan made them extremely annoying and exhausting to complete, and these wheels can take so long on a first playthrough that one might forget what the quest was even about halfway through.

Claws of Awaji fixes this problem. In the expansion, there is only ONE target wheel, and it's optional. Doing it will directly affect a future mission, tying it in well with the main narrative. This target wheel is also far more engaging than the base game's target wheels. Awaji is not a huge place, so getting to all the targets isn't a problem, and these targets can also be drawn out of hiding by picking fights with the enemy factions in the DLC. Cause enough chaos, and the target will come to you, similar to the Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War games. This ties into my next point.

**AWAJI FEELS ALIVE**

On Awaji, we are no longer the hunters. We are the hunted. The enemy faction hides among the people and in the Shadows, and they'll attack you on sight all across the island. They set up traps and tripwires across all the island's roads, so you need to be careful and look out for them. They hide in wait in the bushes and even among civilians. They rig their chests with poison, so you need to be careful when looting. Defeating them pulls out their aforementioned leaders, causing emergent battles anywhere in the world, whether in towns, on the coasts, or even in the mountains. Helping civilians can also earn you information on these leaders so you can seek them out on your own.

Compare this to the base game, where the world had no purpose besides a scenic route that served no purpose other than a road to the next objective. Awaji is a huge improvement in world design and makes the expansion a lot more fun.

**BETTER DUAL PROTAGONIST HANDLING**

In the base game, Naoe and Yasuke were done dirty by the mission design. They could never be on screen together during gameplay, and they were never in real peril. The dual protagonist system felt like just switching between a single protagonist and pretending that the other one didn't exist. Claws of Awaji is a huge improvement here as well.

"jonydevidson","2025-09-16","This game is such a fucking mess with weird pacing and disjointed storyline, gameplay a Frankenstein's monster of systems. 

Such a shame that the engine and environment teams did such a great job, yet Ubisoft either refuses to let the writers write a good story or refuses to hire good writers. 

Also it's painfully obvious the first 8 hours of the game were remade and hacked together in the short period between Yasuke reveal and launch.","85","comment"
"shieara","2024-12-23","[2024 game review] This is my list of played games for 2024. There were a bunch of games I ""tasted"", meaning I played for an hour or less and decided it wasn't time for that specific game, and those are not included. I did include two games I dropped after a decent time investment. I generally play the main story and side quests, but skip achievements and collect-a-thons. Ratings are based off of how much I liked a game and are completely subjective. Sometimes I like bad games and that's just how it is.



* **Frostpunk** - I don't play a lot of city builders, but I thought this one was great.  Any game that forces me to make morally challenging decisions has my interest. It took a few tries, but I finished each scenario. Sometimes the endings I got weren't perfect, but they were realistic to the situation and this game really emphasized to me that sometimes you have to choose what to sacrifice to reach your goal. Rating 9/10.
* **Fresh Start Cleaning Simulator** - You clean things. That's pretty much it. Sometimes I like having a game that I can turn on and just do something mindless, and this was that game for me. It served its purpose, but I think there are probably better games that would do the same thing. Rating 5/10.
* **Blue Dragon** - This game never really took off, maybe because it was an Xbox exclusive and the PlayStation was more known as the JRPG console, maybe because it had some major flaws. Whatever the reason, I bought a copy years ago and finally sat down to play it. It looks great with the classic Akira Toriyama character designs and a nice looking world. The combat and story are a little basic, but I didn't mind that. Not every villain has to have some kind of complicated backstory for me to enjoy killing them. Sometimes a bad guy can just be bad.  It might have the best boss battle theme of all time. Rating 7/10.
* **Silverfall - Earth Awakening** - This game has been hanging around on my backlog for years. It's kind of like Dungeon Siege.  Almost everything about this game was mid, including the combat, music, voice acting and story. Visually though, it was really distinctive. It has great enemy designs. That wasn't enough to pull it out of mediocrity for me, but it was one positive in an overall average game. Rating 5/10.
* **A Plague Tale: Innocence** - I went into this expecting and actual story about the black plague and came out of it wondering what I had witnessed. This isn't a bad game, but the story went in a direction I didn't really like. Plus the game being a huge escort quest was not something I personally enjoyed. Rating 4/10.
* **Beasts of Maravilla Island** - This is a short photography game that I got for free somewhere. It might have been Amazon Prime games? I think it needed a little longer in the oven. My problem with the game is that it didn't encourage you to take good pictures. If you need to take a picture of a creature doing a flip, you shouldn't be able to count just a picture of a flipper. It looks good though and is relaxing to play. Rating 6/10.
* **Broken Sword 1** - This was really good. I used to play a lot of point-and-click adventure games, but Broken Sword always slipped under my radar. I'm glad this was the year I finally started the series. Nico and George were fun main characters, although I would have liked the time playing them to be split instead of playing as George most of the time. It looked good and had solid voice acting. The puzzles were mostly logical, although I had to look a few up. It had a fun story too. Rating 9/10.
* **Pyre** - I enjoyed the visual novel sections and the story for this game. The characters were great. Unfortunately I hated the game sections. I've never been a sports game person. One thing I really liked about this was that the story progresses, even if you lose games. There were a few matchups that I even lost on purpose. Rating 7/10.
* **A Hat in Time** - I had fun with this once I accepted that each world was going to be a different playstyle and vibe. I think this game just has a lot of style. It doesn't do anything amazing with the gameplay, but the style kind of carries it forward. I didn't mess with mods, but I think they are available and would add a lot to the experience. Rating 8/10.
* **The Stillness of the Wind** - Every year I try an ""art"" game, and each year I end up being confused. In this game you play as an old woman who is separated from her family that lives in the city. You get regular messages about how they are doing, but things eventually degrade. I can't say more without spoiling the game, but it does have an interesting ending. It's a very slow game as well. Rating 6/10.
* **Dungeon Keeper 1** - I've played this a bunch in the past, but this is the first time I completed the game. Probably everyone knows about this game, but it's a RTS where you play as a ""Dungeon Keeper"" and slowly take over the world. There's no elaborate story here, but it has a great narrator. The gameplay can get repetit","83","post"
"TheLandstrider","2024-12-15","[Insights from the Games I Played in 2024: A Year in Review] Hey everyone!

Hope you’re all doing well. This year, I had a lot of free time since I spent most of it at home waiting for my visa, which took its sweet time to arrive. Naturally, I ended up diving headfirst into gaming, and for the first—and probably last—time in my life, I managed to play and finish 30+ games. please don't judge, I swear I have a life usually, it just was put on hold until bureaucracy was done beating my ass.

**1. Celeste: 9/10**  
What a fantastic way to kick off the year. While I didn’t fully resonate with the mental health messaging everyone hyped, for me, it was simply a thrilling, complex platformer with a satisfying difficulty curve. If you’re a fan of 2D platformers, this one’s a no-brainer—a must-buy.

**2. SIGNALIS: 10/10**  
This game is on a whole different level. I’m not big on horror games, but *SIGNALIS* blew me away. The creepy atmosphere, gripping story, and unraveling its cryptic lore had me hooked. The art, the sound design, the music—it’s all perfection. Creepy, beautiful, and utterly unforgettable.

**3. Deadlink: 7/10**  
I was hyped for this one, and it delivered… mostly. It’s fun and challenging, but as a roguelike, it didn’t grab me like *Dead Cells* or *Hades*. I didn’t experiment much with characters or builds, which kind of dulled the replayability. Good, but not great.

**4. CULTIC: 10/10**  
Pure chaos and fun. A boomer-shooter heavily inspired by *Doom* (the OGs), and it wears that inspiration with pride. I loved it so much I finished it twice on the highest difficulty. An awesome art style, hard hitting music and moments of genuinely creepy atmosphere. Totally worth it.

**5. Vigil: The Longest Night: 5/10**  
A strange blend of *Dark Souls* and Metroidvania, but for me, it missed the mark. The levels weren’t particularly fun. If you’re looking for a 2D *Dark Souls* experience, *Salt and Sanctuary* does it much better imo.

**6. System Shock Remake: 7.5/10**  
I learned the hard way not to throw key items in this game—*especially* on medium difficulty where they don't warn you! That aside, it was solid. The gameplay felt fresh, even if the setting wasn’t groundbreaking, they still managed to pull it off in an intersting way. Sometimes, a classic done well is all you need.

**7. Contraband Police: 8/10**  
As a Syrian, the communist-country vibes hit close to home—maybe a little too close. Inspecting cars and upgrading the station was a blast, but the shooting and fighting mechanics were a wasted opportunity. They didn’t add much and took away from the core experience. Still, if you loved *Papers, Please*, you’ll surely enjoy this.

**8. Sea of Stars: 7/10**  
This game’s pixel art is a masterpiece—easily the best I’ve seen in years. Sadly, I’m not a JRPG fan, so the pacing felt like a slog, and the story didn’t grab me. It’s hugely popular, though, so if JRPGs are your thing, you’ll love it. Me personally, I learned that JRPGs aren't for me through this game.

**9. Jagged Alliance 3: 8.5/10**  
As an XCOM fan, this scratched the tactical itch. Managing resources, assembling the perfect team, and fending off enemy attacks kept me on edge. It’s unforgiving but engaging, with a dose of humor to lighten the tension.

**10. Nier: Automata: 9/10**  
Came for the thighs, left with the cries. 9/10.

**11. Cyberpunk 2077: 9/10**  
Flawed but brilliant. The storytelling, world-building, and characters by CD Projekt Red are truly unmatched. Sure, there are bugs, no third-person view, and balancing issues (even in version 2.0), but the parts done right are good enough to engage you for multiple playthroughs. And truly Night City itself is the true star of the show. A must-play.

**12. Grounded: 8.5/10**  
I played this with a dear friend before immigrating, and at this point it's less of a game and more of a pile of  memories and nostalgia that I try nowadays not to think about too often ( and it's not just because of the wolf spiders you see everywhere you go in this game). Therefore, take my words with a pinch of salt:  Grounded is a wonderfully creative survival game with a unique twist where you are shrunk down to the size of insects in a backyard teeming with bugs, from small mites to relatively giant spiders. It was a blast exploring around and trying to finish the main quest where you wanna go back to your original size.

**13. Portal & Portal 2: 10/10**  
Timeless classics. Fun, engaging, and just perfect puzzle games.

**14. Pentiment: 7/10**  
This was a bit overhyped for me. I expected a killer story with impactful choices, but it didn’t quite deliver. However, the art style, inspired by 1500s religious manuscripts, is stunning. While it’s not groundbreaking, it’s still a unique experience worth trying if you are okay with mostly reading through your videogame.

**15. Max Payne & Max Payne 2: 9/10**  
What’s not to love? I played these as a kid and revisited them as an adult. The gritty action and","83","post"
"mmzufti","2025-01-24","Really nice trailer. Playing Naoe will be fun because how stealth focused her part will be, which will be a relief since how action packed the last three games were. Seeing the Templar symbol again after Syndicate is exciting and the score is as usual, Ubisoft’s best ability. I sincerely hope they cut down the order killing missions because they can get incredibly repetitive.

The story, from the trailer at least, seems to be about revenge (Naoe) and change of heart (Yasuke) which doesn’t sound much interesting but I am optimistic nonetheless. I hope both characters are their stories are well-written. Their enemies to allies part is interesting.","83","comment"
"ChePelos53","2025-04-14","[My thoughts on AC Shadows after 127 hours [SPOILERS]] I though on doing a full AC Shadows Review  but I honestly think I don't have the enough writing skills to do so, so instead of that I'm just going to write some of my fresh impressions after finishing the main story yesterday:

-World: the map is, without a doubt one of the best and most beautiful open worlds ever, whoever I think you can compare it to a painting, it's beautiful to look at it but that's all, the towns feel really empty, it has less npcs than the other RPG games, and everything is just too silent, you don't hear people talking even tho you can see their lips moving I know they wanted to go for a more calm and serious tone, but do it on the temples, the cities should be loud. And please oh please Ubisoft give us back the ability to change time!!!! I missed it so damn much! 

-Combat: I really loved it, I think it's my favorite of the RPGs, Yasuke is a force of nature I love the Naginata, Bow combo it feels so cool to storm in a castle and break havoc, Naoe is also very cool all her animations are fast and slick.

-Stealth: Naoe is amazing when it comes to stealth she feels like an Assassin from the good old days, the shadow system is cool and I end up using it a lot more that I initially thought I would.

-Story: SPOILERS. I really like the two main characters, I love their relationship the respect and the care they have for each other, they feel like siblings, to be honest I haven't been this invested in AC main characters story since Bayek, Their personal missions are amazing, Yasuke's backstory really moved me the last mission, killing Nuno Caro had me really exited the ""My name is Yasuke"" part was just very hype. and I'm very interested on seeing what's next for Naoe, I loved all her interactios with Hanzo and Junjiro finding brotherhood secrets and being an actual Assassin (Kakushiba Ikki I guess) felt amazing, Act 1 and 3 are really really good, but damn, Act 2 is very bad, I had to take a break from the game because I was getting really boring, the Shinbakufu stories are short and dull, I don't remember most of their names, most of them were really forgettable.
Also wtf was that ending?? I watched a Luke Stephens video yesterday that said that the original ending was cut, and yeah that's obvious! The game feels incomplete, how can a game end without having a proper ending for one of the main characters, Awaji was definitely the last part of the story.

Miscellaneous:

-The camera when playing as Yasuke is way to close, he literally takes 1/3 of the screen and it even gets closer when you run, even tho I loved playing as him I got very frustrated with the camera, please Ubisoft let us modify it it has no reason to be this close.

-The hideout is cool I really enjoy changing all the buildings and the decorations, but please let us have more animals!!!

-Finding missing pages on the temples is maybe the most boring and pointless activity in the whole AC franchise.

-The whole ""Yokai"" quest was amazing It reminded me of the AC3 frontier missions where you uncover the truth behind north American myths, I love how the Shadows team implemented the Yokai on a game based in the XVI century when it just wouldn't make sense to have actual Yokai

So this is my personal opinion on the game, is a really good game with a lot of positive points but the boring act 2 and activities really hurts it, It's definitely miles better than Valhalla but is not as fun as Odyssey and not as memorable as Origins.

As a side note, I really hope we get to visit China and Korea, Korea would make a lot of sense now that we're entering Hideyoshi's time in power, I would also love a full expansion 20 years later with an older Naoe during the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, I really do think Ieyasu Tokugawa shoul be really important in future expansions","81","post"
"AllFatherMedia93","2024-12-21","[Reasons why the marketing has been so limited] Ok so hear me out. Ever since the delay the marketing has been very quiet overall. And you'll notice that what we have had has very much been dedicated to hardcore fans rather than the general audience: Deep dive articles and Reddit QAs.

That's the kinda stuff made for fans who are already going to buy the game, the ones who want the nitty gritty details.

Now I'm sure we will still get a big story trailer, another gameplay walkthrough and much more closer to launch. But I don't think they are going to go really, really big on the marketing for three main reasons:

> 1. This game has had so much controversy and negative discourse that no matter what they post or where they post it, they'll get lots of hate comments. I know this first hand covering the game on my youtube channel. My Shadows videos attract the absolute worst kinds of people to the comments. It's a no-win situation for Ubisoft. Even if it's just a vocal minority, they're *very vocal* and it's not a good look when your trailers have lots of down votes and comments on how ""the game looks trash"", even when it looks great.

> 2. They actually think the game is good enough to create strong word of mouth on release and are playing the long game. Don't underestimate the power of word of mouth. If the game comes out and gets good reviews and actually changes people's opinions, it will sell well in the long term.

> 3. Marketing is expensive and Ubisoft are in a tight spot right now.","81","post"
"JorRaptor","2024-12-11","Some very nerdy combat based questions:

\#1 Are the guardian enemies mentioned in the combat article unlimited (do they continuously spawn?) or can you at one point get rid of all of them?

\#2 Does Yasuke put the ranged weapons in his main weapon slots or are there seperate ranged slots? So does using the Yumi bow for example mean that you only have 1 melee weapon that you can then switch to? If yes, can you then switch between the rifle and bow as one playstyle?

\#3 With the 'link-attack ability' can you also rapidly switch between melee and ranged weapons for special combo's?

\#4 Any more info you can give about the 'fight tournaments'?

"SOUTHPAWMIKE","2025-05-01","I know Valhalla isn't a lot of peoples' favorite, but I really liked how to advance the story, you'd go to that table in your base and commit to a specific region, and then you'd go do that region's main quest. Sure, it's a little gamified, but it was a great way to keep the player's activity focused and on track. Plus you were still free to go explore anywhere you wanted to.

I wish Shadows was similar. Let me just focus on clearing out Wakasa, then Omi, then Yamashiro (not necessarily in that order), don't make me chase around a bunch of random targets that may or may not be present in any of those provinces.","77","comment"
"AnanasMango","2025-03-19","As long as it doesn't get a shit score, reviews don't matter much with the giant IPs.

Valhalla made over a billion in revenue  
Origins and Odyssey sold over 10 million copies.

Shadows is around the same ballpark based on Metacritic/Opencritic. So 10+ million sales is very realistic in my opinion. Don't know what people have in mind when they think about ""savior"".

Coming from their previous releases, a 10+ million hit should qualify as ""savior""/ big success.","77","comment"

I, admittedly, don't remember a lot about this game or it's story. But, I remember how it was so much more amazing than The Land Before Time (no shade). 

I've looked this game up every now and then, emulated it a few times for a brief nostalgia trip, and then forgot about it until it came back around.

Here's SkillUp's preview titled: [I wasn't having much fun with: Assassin's Creed Shadows (Hands-On Impressions)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAlobYH_zzM)

He makes really good points about how Yasuke isn't just very limited (doesn't really have access to 2/3rds of the AC systems: parkour and stealth) but he's also not very immersive.  He moves way too fast for his size and can charge through literal concrete.  And for some reason he screams every time you assassinate someone so there's only one way to play him. Combat is all he's got and the combat isn't very interesting or deep.

And because he's so limited in his parkour, even exploring the world as him doesn't make much sense unless you want to be sitting in loading screens the whole time.

He goes on to say the writing isn't very good and all the characters (the main two and everyone you meet) feels ""lifeless and dull and robotic"".

And the whole ""scout"" system Ubi has been proudly talking about is...just menu options.  You're just pointing at markers and waiting for markers to appear.  It's just standard Ubi time-gating.

He finishes by guessing that the game is probably a lot more fun as Naoie, since she has more variety and options and can fully utilize the sandbox nature of the game.  It's just a shame for people who wanted to play as Yasuke.

All in all, I'm glad I saw his because I'd rather have a full picture of the preview, than just hype and marketing.","74","comment"

"therottenworld","2024-12-28","[After several Resident Evil games, I've realized I'm addicted to the gameplay loop (RE HD Remaster review)] I thought I wasn't much one for horror games but I played RE4 a decade ago and fell in love. Then I never really tried any RE games until the RE4 Remake came out which got me hooked again. Then I proceeded to play RE7 the same year, then RE8 this year on the hardest difficulty which was intimidating, but really helped me get hooked even more. The feeling of scarcity weirdly makes the game more addictive. The feeling when you do overcome scary encounters, and when you do make it through, barely teetering on running out of bullets, the feeling when you're careful with your ammo and then slowly start stacking it up, then ""spend"" it like currency to eliminate obstacles. I followed that with a Village of Shadows replay with infinite ammo to have fun. At that point I felt addicted, and I wanted to try the older games.

So I tried Resident Evil HD Remaster which I played on the highest available difficulty at the start to get that survival experience, and that was difficult to get into, but after dying a lot and looking up how to think about it I got a feel for balancing dodging enemies and using my ammo on them. Now I beat it and I think next I'm doing a Jill playthrough on Hard, to get the complete experience. I also bought and installed RE0 already and I'm excited to try that too.

The feeling of each shot mattering is just strangely addictive. There is a rush in balancing spending your low resources and eliminating necessary threats. You have to do sections as well as possible so you minimize what you use for it, and I reloaded saves sometimes when I just plain made very avoidable mistakes, to restart my new progression attempt. Speaking of saves, you have a limited amount. So your progression is a loop of exploring, probably not caring about dying, seeing what you have access to, and then reloading to do it properly and make an actual attempt at progressing. And then you've probably made a significant amount of progress (you have to judge for yourself how much that is, but it's usually a few risky encounters and about 20-30 minutes of gameplay) and can finally make a new checkpoint to repeat this loop from.

There are absurd ""open a book and take a round medal out that you need later so you can put it in a fountain and open up a passage to an underground lab"" kind of key item puzzles that are very satisfying even though they make no sense from an architectural point of view (why was this built into the mansion?).

When you pick up a new key item, there's always a very rewarding feeling to it, because more of the game has now opened up to you. Areas that were red doors on the map before are now accessible. A lot of the times I memorized more or less where some of these doors were and then immediately went and sought them out in excitement (or saved first if it had been a while).

I also want to emulate the originals, and I still have RE2 Remake which is a treat. All in all this experience the past year or so with these games made me realize I feel completely hooked on the thrilling gameplay loop. There is just nothing out there like it except other survival horror games, specifically the ones that imitate RE's brand of survival horror. I am also looking forward to playing the Silent Hill series, as while I know it's not quite the same type of survival horror as RE, I believe it will probably satisfy a similar itch.","74","post"
"Kasur1309","2025-04-06","[Assassin's Creed Shadows: A game that knows what it wants to be] In an era where AAA games often try to be everything to everyone, Assassin’s Creed Shadows refreshingly knows exactly what it is: the perfect game to relax with after a long workday.

# Sam Fisher would be proud

It starts with the core of any game, the gameplay. Shadows focuses on stealth gameplay and does it so well that it’s easily the best stealth game since Metal Gear Solid 5.

One time I sneaked into a castle after nightfall. My heart was racing every time I tried to sneak from shadow to shadow to not be seen. Taking out guards one by one can feel like a little puzzle and if it all works out the way you plan it, it feels so satisfying. **I’m a huge Splinter Cell fan and honestly I have missed this feeling.** Moments like this make it clear that playing as Naoe is the heart of the game.

Now some people might say that the Yasuke part doesn’t fit in. His brute force approach is the total opposite of Naoe. However I think Ubisoft knew exactly that players would want a change of pace once in a while in such a huge game and that is exactly Yasuke’s role. A fun sidekick that also delivers a great story.

# Virtual Tourism

Let’s just get this out of the way. Shadows is stunning! The 4 different seasons, day and night cycle, the weather system! Never before a world felt so alive visually. I think it’s really a big reason why Shadows is such a good game. It’s simply fun and relaxing to explore a world that is this beautiful. **A real highlight is the weather.** The way storms build up is never seen before in a Video Game. It simply feels real. I couldn’t count how many times I turned my laptop screen to my fiancé and went “Look hunny look that’s so beautiful!”.

But the seasons aren’t just for the looks, they also affect gameplay. If you stealth in the snow the game feels completely different than in the summer and often you also have to change your approach to situations as a result of that.

You can also find many secrets, caves and easter eggs in Shadows. But best of all you feel like you are exploring old japan. Seeing these old towns and temples is impressive and I could easily spend an hour just looking around at one of these temples and taking in all the details.

# The perfect game after a long workday

All of this brings us to Shadows target Audience. Players who want to have a fun game to play for an hour after a long work day. Everything in Shadows is built to fit this. Starting with the story that is divided into bite-sized parts between 10-30 minutes. **The story is also easy to follow and always provides fun smaller story beats that feel like an episode of a great TV show.** I think Shadows is the type of game that you could take on hold for 3 months and simply return to it and still feel like you know what’s going on. 

But it’s not just the Story. Also, the gameplay parts. It’s easy to select what part of the map you want to explore next. You only have 30 Minutes? You should select a castle to sneak into. You feel too tired for stealth after a long day? Pick Yasuke and clear the castle that way! Or you just do a bit of Virtual Tourism and explore a beautiful world and take pictures with the stunning photo mode. 

All of this shows me that Ubisoft knew what game they wanted to make. Now granted if you want your next main game that you play for 5 hours a day or that challenges you and makes you engage with 20 different systems then AC Shadows might not be for you.

I can easily see how it could become repetitive in long play sessions and how players could miss a real challenge from time to time. But if you’re looking for a game to play each day after work for an hour and that really immerses you into another world then AC Shadows could be exactly what you’re looking for.

That’s what makes it so hard to put a score number on Shadows. It clearly has weak spots but most of them are by design. Shadows is in many ways like your favorite anime or TV show. **It gives you comfort after a long day and after a few hours of playtime you know what to expect but that’s not a bad thing, it’s comforting.** Assassin’s Creed Shadows is exactly the game it wants to be and that makes it a real gem in its own way.

**Rating: Recommended**

"hkf999","2025-04-24","If I had to guess, I would probably say that they decided to cut some stuff when the launch was delayed. You can see some scissor marks in the finished product. Other things I have noticed:

1: The Naoe meditations. At the start of the games they trigger flashbacks, then this suddenly stops and she just starts repeating platitudes instead.

2: The temple ""mini-game"". You're collecting pages, but what are they? Why are you collecting them? This was clearly supposed to be something at some point. Lore entries, pieces of a bigger puzzle, anything. Same with the praying at shrines. This doesn't do anything.

3: The hideout. You collect all these NPCs, and then hide them away there and forget them. I think there was supposed to be side quests and stuff happening there. I only went to the hideout maybe 3 or 4 times the entire playthrough. There was nothing to do there other than placing bushes. In Valhalla there was loads to do there.

4: The third act. This one seems incredibly rushed, compared to the very long second act where you take down the shinbakufu. It's over before it starts and the pacing is very weird.

5: The animus stuff. I have to assume there was supposed to be more there. It seems like a reduced version of what was originally a wider picture. The Ego and The Guide stuff seems like what happens when you tell a temp worker to ""just write some Animus stuff before you leave"" at 2pm on a friday.","72","comment"

"VastSuggestion1341","2025-09-14","People love to crap both on the original Desmond storyline, and on AC Valhalla, but to me, Valhalla's story was finally something exciting - lots of Isu stuff, callbacks all the way to Ezio, and the introduction of The Reader and the ""*New Present Story Guy*""... 

Yea, all that shit lead to NOWHERE. I don't even get the point of Shadows.

The Naoe-Yasuke storyline is bland, and the present storyline is nonexistent. The whole ""*masked men who don't even wear masks, and don't even know each other, and to be fair, they don't even know their own organisation*"" main story was fucking disappointing.

Also, just a ""fun"" oversight - I randomly found the (not-)masked Leader in the open world, scanned them because they were marked, and the game fucking revealed their identity, lol. I killed only about 3-4 main targets at this point, I've never even seen the character that was revealed as my final target.","69","comment"
"Emotional-Log-8026","2025-05-27","[Could Assassin’s Creed ever return to the kind of storytelling seen in AC1 and AC3?] Each Assassin’s Creed title has its own unique tone and narrative direction, but personally, I’ve always found the stories of AC1 and AC3 to be the most compelling.

Many entries in the series tend to frame the Assassins as noble protectors of freedom and society, while portraying the Templars as authoritarian villains aiming for control—essentially a clear-cut good vs. evil dynamic. These narratives often follow a fairly straightforward moral trajectory, which can feel predictable.

However, AC1 and AC3 stood out precisely because they deviated from this binary. AC1, as the series' debut, already hinted at a morally gray conflict, and AC3 took that further. It used the backdrop of the American Revolution and the character of Haytham Kenway to flesh out the ideological conflict between the Assassins and Templars in a much more nuanced way. The struggle wasn't simply about good versus evil, but about freedom versus order, and how both sides have their flaws.

Unfortunately, AC1 is often underrated due to its repetitive gameplay and being the first in the franchise, and AC3 received mixed reviews for its abrupt pacing and some clunky mechanics. As a result, the more complex ideological storytelling seemed to fade after AC3. While Unity still showed some traces of this approach, from Syndicate onward, the series leaned heavily into simplified narratives where Assassins are clearly heroic and Templars clearly villainous, often losing the moral ambiguity that made earlier entries so thought-provoking.

I had some hope that Mirage would bring back the introspective tone of AC1, especially with its focus on internal conflict within the Brotherhood. Sadly, while there were glimpses of this in the first half, the game quickly devolved into a rushed and uneven ending that failed to fully explore these themes.

And now with Shadows developed by Ubisoft Quebec—the same team behind Syndicate and Odyssey, both of which had some of the weakest stories in the franchise—I was honestly not expecting much in terms of depth or nuance. And now, it looks like that expectation might hold.

I’m curious—what do *you* think of the narratives in AC1 and AC3? Do you miss that ideological conflict? And what direction do you hope the Assassin’s Creed series takes in the future, story-wise?","69","post"
"Patient_Gamemer","2025-04-12","[From Prince of Persia to Assassin's Creed: a ""Ubisoftian"" retrospective for the un-initiated] Being one of the world's largest game publishers, Ubisoft has gathered plenty of beloved IPs under its belt: Rayman, Driver, Splinter Cell and the Tom Clancy games in general, Anno and The Settlers, the Crew, Might and Magic... however, imho these two, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed, by Ubisoft Montreal are the ones most people relate with the Ubisoft name, two franchises that have lots of love but have also gained the ire of many people, specially due to the poor reputation Ubisot has made the last few years.

AC 1 and 2 are two of my favourite games of all time and, while I haven't played *all* the games I'll discuss here, I do consider myself a strong enough ""connoisseur"" of the franchise to try and share its story with you. Other fans might appreciate what I'll write here, although I think this will be more useful for people who have heard of the games but don't know where to start, or are only familiar with one or two of them and are interested in the rest. Obviously this is only text but you can complement it with one of those ""history of X franchise"" videos of youtube that shows you the difference in graphics.

Our tale begins in 1989, when Jordan Mechner makes **Prince of Persia**, a side-scrolling platformer game, in a time where Super Mario was the definition of gaming. This is game has two main traits, a middle-eastern setting inspired by the Arabian Nights with a plot eerily similar to Disney's Aladdin (street thief rescues a princess from evil Vizier called ""Jaffar"", despite being released years before the Disney movie); and slow methodic realistic platforming, made with rotoscopy, so that, unlike the unrealistic jumps of Super Mario, the protagonist jumps and climbs the way a normal human would.

Despite the first game being originally an Apple II exclusive, it would soon see ports to other PCs and consoles, as well as two sequels: **Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame,** which doubles down on the same concepts; and **Prince of Persia 3D**, one of those failed attempts at a jump to 3D who almost killed the whole franchise, alongside our story.

However you know how it went: Ubisoft acquired the rights to Prince of Persia and with the original creator made **Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,** a remake-but-not-really of PoP1 that triumphed where Pop3D failed. Here the protagonist is the titular Prince of Persia who gets in an adventure to fight alongside the princess against the evil Vizier, with the same focus on **cinematic platforming** as well as some combat. This game also saw the introduction of the titular sands of time, that allows us to rewind time to undo failed jumps that would lead to our demise, albeit with some restrictions.

The Sands of Time would sell well enough to deserve its own trilogy for the 6th generation, each game with its own handheld port. The second game would be **Prince of Persia: Warrior Within**, which took the series in a much darker, mature, violent and overall edgy tone. Think ""Prince of Persia meets Devil May Cry"" and you'll get a good enough idea. After the events of the first game, the Prince is being chased by the Dahaka, an dark creature who wants to destroy us for our unnatural tampering of time. Apart of the rock music by Slipknot and oversexualized female characters, Warrior Within also features a stronger focus on **combat**, being almost a hack-and-slash through and through, much to the dismay of the original creator, which saw his child go through a rough adolescence.

The final part in the trilogy, the **Prince of Persia: the Two Thrones** was partly a return to form, to more vibrant colors and a less edgy protagonist, being the most polished game of the trilogy. In this game the Prince returns to his home of Babylon only to see it besieged by the Scythians, which prompt him to once again take arms against against a resurrected Vizier. While he looks and acts way more mature now, we do have access to the ""second throne"", the Dark Prince, a relic of Warrior Within that keeps its edge and savagery. However, probably the most interesting introduction here is a new **assassination** mechanic that allow us to kill enemies in a single hit, that is if we manage strike them from behind. So far it's only a gimmick but I'm sure you already know it's foreshadowing for where the series will go next...

With a new generation of consoles around the corner, PS3 and Xbox360, the guys at Ubisoft Montreal decided to squeeze their brains for a new idea, and decided to make a spin-off of Prince of Persia, after finding out about the Assassins. In real life, the Order of the Hashashins was a radical religious cult that perpetrated multiple political assassinations during the Middle Ages, so they offered a perfect opportunity for a stealth-centric Prince of Persia. Pieces were slowly falling in place and eventually Prince of Persia: Assassin turned into  **Assa","69","post"

"Potatosaurus_TH","2025-03-25","I'd love an option to auto switch target to the enemy recently parried, like an enemy would be attacking you from behind and you do a perfect block and the enemy becomes vulnerable and glow orange, so you immediately counterattack but since you are still locked on to the previous enemy you whiff the counterattack.

Also changing Loadout in the menu summons the horse for some reason and that broke my stealth a couple of times already. The horse ran up to me in the middle of an enemy camp and caused an uproar. Please stop it from doing that. Even better if you can implement some sort of switch loadout button without having to go to the menu. EVEN better if you let Naoe equip all 3 weapons and just switch to them on the fly. She wears them in different places anyway so there's really no need to limit to 2 weapons at a time.

Other than those nitpicks, loving the game so far.","66","comment"

"Zayl","2025-03-29","Honestly what have we been asking for? A greater focus on the main story and otherwise just assassination contracts. 

What did we get with Shadows? A greater focus on the main story and then a bunch of optional assassination contracts. If you read the letters, objective board, and pay attention to environmental storytelling there's a whole lot of information about these targets out there. You also encounter loads of NPCs in the world that offer more info about them all if you just listen. 

All in all I agree with you. Shadows is my ideal format for assassin's creed. The suggestions I've seen in this sub lately make me a bit more inclined to agree with Reddit that AC is consumed a lot by more casual gamers. So many feature requests/change requests are ""make the game play for me and spoonfeed me everything"".","65","comment"
"jransom98","2025-03-29","I think it suffers from the same issue of the past few where it's front loaded with interesting stuff, and then has a long, repetitive middle. There's fat you could trim. Most of the main targets don't feel like they're actually contributing to the main story.

I think the games recently that let you do stuff in almost any order just generally suffer from that, because the story pacing feels weird. The majority of the game has to be written in a way where it can happen in any sequence and make sense, so like the Omi main target missions have no real bearing on the Harima missions, etc. And in a character driven game, that hurts their development.

Yasuke and Naoe's friendship goes from nonexistent/tense to close friends in basically two cutscenes, and we don't get to really see how they get there because the game can't do that. Most of their development is in their individual character side arcs, which in a more linear game would be integrated better into the main story.","64","comment"
"NoNefariousness2144","2025-03-27","The biggest strength of the game is making Naoe and Yasuke play so differently. It gave them the freedom to make Naoe far more agile yet weaker than other AC characters, while Yasuke is the complete opposite to make him a nice change of pace from the stealth gameplay.

Valhalla and Odyssey got dull after a while for me because the gameplay of Evior and Kassandra never really changed. But in Shadows I can yo-yo between two complete opposite playstyles.","63","comment"

"coolwali","2025-03-19","[A brief review of Splinter Cell Conviction on the highest difficulty]  Hello everyone. I recently beat Splinter Cell Conviction on its highest difficulty and wished to talk about it.



Firstly the game was rather challenging to get running. Fun fact, I first played Conviction on MacOS back when the game first came out because it was the only Splinter Cell game released on MacOS and on the Mac App Store. It was harder for us poor Mac bois because the Apple Magic Mouse didn't have a middle mouse button and you couldn't do a left and right click at the same time. I recall the Mac Port even warned you about this and suggest rebinding ADS to ""Option/Alt"". Those were wild times.



However, the game is no longer playable on Mac (Intel or Silicon) as the older Ubisoft Launcher no longer runs on Mac and Mac no longer supports 32 bit apps as of MacOS Catalina. In fact, a lot of older Mac Ports from the time like the early Assassin's Creed, Batman Arkham Tomb Raider, Bioshock, GTA and Borderlands games are unplayable now (unless you are a wizard with Wine and Rosetta). I tried running Conviction on my Mac running Linux Mint and no dice. The game and its Ubisoft Launcher didn't play nicely so I had to play this game on an Asus Vivobook Laptop running Windows 11 and the game in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode which still had issues. The game's performance and framerate kept chugging and would crash frequently. As someone who is ""a complete baby in the world of PC gaming"", I had to do something scary and install my first mod. The Conviction Fusion Mod which eased some of the performance issues and made the crashes a bit less frequent. It was confusing as the mod's instructions said ""just extract and throw in the folder where the game executable is"". I did literally that but it turns out you have to extract the folder and grab the stuff inside and paste that into executable's location.

 

This made some improvements. The controls were now closer to Spinter Cell Blacklist. The game was chugging a bit less and it skipped all the introductions when you first boot the game. But the game still crashed every 30-40 minutes. It would freeze for around a minute and then crash to desktop...... sometimes. Other times, pressing Escape would save the game after a minute and unfreeze it. The game's checkpoint system was generally good enough that I never lost a ton of progress and the game loaded pretty fast but it meant I couldn't really play the Deniable Ops missions for fear of losing everything. I imagine that wiser and more experienced PC gamers than me would probably and easily identify and fix these issues in my place but alas.  


 

Back to the game itself, Conviction's highest difficulty, called ""Realistic"", mostly just tweaks damage, health and detection numbers. Enemies can detect Sam in light in under half a second from pretty far away, and can kill Sam almost as quickly. I also noticed ammo from guns you picked up seemed to be slightly lower though I am unsure of this. Enemy AI also didn't seem to be affected so it doesn't appear that enemies get new moves or tactics on Realistic Difficulty. Now, I have played other shooters from the time on their hardest difficulties like the Uncharted and COD games of the time and noticed I had a lot more fun on Conviction than these games which is what inspired me to write this post.

 

 Lets begin by talking briefly about Uncharted 2 and 3 which released around the same time as Conviction. Uncharted's 3rd person shooting gameplay gives the player quite a few options in combat such as climbing, melee/hand-to-hand, pulling enemies of ledges, swimming, swinging off ropes, taking cover, performing cover takedowns etc. As well as holding one pistol, one 2 handed gun and grenades. Uncharted on its easy and medium difficulties is quite fun as you can run-and-gun throughout the arena using all the cool movement options, alternating between melee and gunplay and brief respites in cover to heal before resuming combat. It's quite fun. I want to shout out that one shipyard gunfight in Uncharted 3. That level and encounter was peak.

 

However, Uncharted's hardest difficulty, Crushing, makes a lot of those options unviable as you get melted quickly for exiting cover. Gunfights often feel more tedious as you're pinned behind cover, occasionally popping out to do a few quick shots before immediately returning to cover and healing off the damage. You can’t really re-enter stealth or move around as efficiently. In my experience, I found I spend around 90% of an Uncharted crushing firefight waiting behind cover healing off damage, 5% shooting enemies and 5% moving around. Rather than testing my skills, I felt these gunfights were more a test of patience and luck as when I completed them, it was more because I finally got done slowly chipping enemies away from cover. If I had to replay the firefight, I don't feel like I would magically and skillfully complete it again faster.

 

I bring all this up ","62","post"

"PhysicsAnonie","2025-03-31","I’m around 45 hours in and haven’t even finished the second arc, I’m having loads of fun and expecting the same for the upcoming 40 ish hours. Ironically the things you find most boring are the parts where I have most fun. 

I love the combat, it’s my personal favorite in the entire franchise, it’s deliberate, quick and satisfying. If you find it boring I recommend changing the difficulty to expert and not relying too much on an (early) dodge, parry everything you can parry and when the red attack does come dodge it last moment.

I really liked the Kuji-kiri memories there’s only a few of them and after it just becomes like a normal activity, I thought it was great way to slowly give us pieces of Naoe history. 

For exploration, I think the rewards are pretty good, especially cause it’s not as bloated as previous games. Yeah sure sometimes you just run into a shrine, temple or viewing point which gameplay wise isn’t as rewarding as a castle, legendary chest, tomb or parkour run, but you know just mastery points are also pretty useful. Regardless I’ve found so far my drive for exploration is mainly coming from genuinely just wanting to see more of the world rather than a new katana or tanto. 

For side quests, yeah we’ve had better. But the quests you are looking for they are there, might just a while before you run into them.","60","comment"

I’ve spent over 100 hours in Shadows, and as a longtime AC fan, I wrote this in-depth review sharing what I loved, what didn’t land for me, and what I hope Ubisoft builds on. Spoiler-free. Focused on story, gameplay, side content, and potential improvements.

# Assassin's Creed: Shadows. A Game At War With Its Own Greatness

Hey there! I've been playing AC Shadows since the minute it released on Steam. Been a fan since Brotherhood. AC is one of my all-time favorite franchises. Odyssey is my personal best in the franchise, so when I found out that the same team was working on Shadows, I had very high hopes!

Before I start, these are my comprehensive thoughts on the game! I know that not many people will want to read this from start to finish, but I'd love to treat it as a discussion. It's the most massive online post I've ever worked on (Around 5100 words). Feel free to skip to whatever category you want and share your thoughts, say what you want improved in the comments, skim through it quickly, or just skip if it's too much to read. With that out of the way, I'm gonna completely NERD OUT on this game right here in a NON SPOILER way.

I'll start with the game's WEAKNESSES, because I want to get them out of the way so that I can begin my rain of praises on the game. I'm hoping my feedback can somehow help this game improve into the greatest game in the series, because the potential is there.

# The Story (Weakness Number 1)

Without any spoilers, the story is split up into ACT 1, ACT 2, ACT 3, and an epilogue. The best way to review the story of this game is to go act by act, because each act feels different.

**ACT 1**

This is peak AC. One of the best beginnings to an AC game ever. It took me 25 hours to complete, and for those first 25 hours, Shadows was MY FAVORITE AC game, ever... The story sets up the two main protagonists and the overall conflicts of the world in a great way. I was all in on Naoe and Yasuke from the first minute. This act got me emotionally invested in both characters with beautifully rendered cutscenes, amazing soundtracks from TEKE TEKE and Thunderdrum, and a well-written beginning. My experience of AC Shadows for the first 25 hours was honestly a 10/10!!!

**ACT 2**

A complete slog with some high points here and there. After the excellent ACT 1, ACT 2 opens up the story and adopts a structure similar to Valhalla, where we have a literal checklist of quests and we can do them in any order. The story suffers GREATLY from this approach. Due to these self-contained stories that happen in no particular order, it feels like there was NO CHARACTER GROWTH at all across this entire act. In fact, both Naoe and Yasuke stopped feeling like characters entirely and started to feel like just vessels for gameplay, with no personality at all. Adding insult to injury, these self-contained stories were combined with side quests that just kept piling on dozens of targets for you to assassinate, making this act feel like a bloated mess.

Now, there are some high points during this act, such as personal stories for one of the protagonists, and some of these self-contained stories were genuinely interesting (and some were terrible). There are also companion quests for each one of the companions that you can recruit. Many of these are genuinely interesting. Unfortunately, the good moments in Act 2 are just too few and far between to save it. Part of me was worried that ACT 2 would be the end of the game, and the rest of the game would've been this boring slog of a story. ACT 2 took me around 35 hours to complete, so I went into Act 3 at around 60 hours in. Overall, I'd give ACT 2 a 5/10.

**ACT 3**

So, remember that high quality from ACT 1? IT COMES BACK!!! Act 3 starts with one of the coolest set-pieces and missions in the game, and it keeps the high quality all the way through. Naoe and Yasuke are characters again, and their stories are compelling here. The story is once again told in a sequence, making it feel less disjointed than ACT 2. The stakes are high here, and we get payoffs that we were waiting on for the entire game. The end of ACT 3 had one of the coolest cutscenes in the entire franchise, and then the game ends... ACT 3 ended after 10 hours. Does the game end in a satisfying way?

NO... IT DOES NOT. IN FACT. THE ENDING WAS A STRAIGHT-UP DISAPPOINTMENT. ACT 3 was still a solid 8/10.

**OVERALL THOUGHTS ON THE STORY**

It's a mixed bag. It has some of the coolest moments in the entire series, and ACT 1 and 3 are generally great. ACT 2 is terrible at times, the pacing is terrible, and it brings down the entire game. Lastly, that ending. One of the main stories of the game didn't even finish, which left a really bad taste. The short epilogue just sets up the rest of that questline to end the game. Making people pay extra to get a complete story is really bad. I'm not sure if the first DLC ","58","post"

Then arrived enemies and when it was time for combat, Basim's limited moveset and that dagger parry took away a few of my excitement to return to the game. I suppose that's why I mainly stealthed in this game in the first place because combat was meh.

The parkour is faster though with the manual jumps. As for the ability to remove safeguards when jumping from high places, now I understand why devs put them in the first place. Jumped unintentionally a lot of times. But maybe something that needs getting used to.","58","post"

I'll admit this is kind of a unique problem i'm experiencing but I went on vacation two weeks ago (international and didn't bring my console with me) and returned this past weekend.  Prior to the trip, I really enjoyed the openness of the game.  Choosing what I wanted to do at any moment felt pretty freeing and I spent several weeks just literally doing whatever I wanted when I wanted.  Because I was playing everyday it was relatively easy to remember stuff from the previous days. 

====

Looking at the game again with fresh eyes after those two weeks away, I realized how overwhelming it can kind of feel not having some kind of optional structure to figure out which targets/side quests to try and focus in on when jumping back into and somewhat of a lack of things that help jog our memory. I spent 10 minutes re-reviewing my objective board and trying to figure out what I wanted to do. Ultimately, I decided to finish up one of my main target kills since I had everything else completed under them (The Fool; >!Ise Sadaoki!<). I did complete it but it just didn't have nearly the same narrative ""oompfh"" that I felt from the other missions.  Partially b/c I just couldn't remember what lead up to the reveal of this character and the info I learned about them during the fact finding missions. 

====

I experienced that same feeling when I did the final mission of the ""Yokai"" substory.  Before I left, I had all but 1 target left. It was Yukki Onna (Omni? Omi? area in a cave but you have to wait till Winter to do it). Spoilers for the end of that quest chain ahead, skip it if you don't wanna read that part. >!After getting that done and returning back to the old man to ""meet"" that new opponent that is actually a Yokai.  I again felt kind of disconnected to that conclusion b/c I just couldn't remember who this person was originally. So the (i'm assuming) ""shock reveal"" of someone we wrote off being an actual Yokai during our Yokai storyline didn't really resonate with me the way I thought it would.!< But the jist is that, a lack of flashbacks and ways to help remind me of something from the previous part of the quest chain made it hard for me to feel that narrative ""oompfh"" that the devs tried to invest in at the conclusion of that quest chain. 

====

______________

====

In a perfect world, I feel like open world AC games would be much more linear.  Similar to the Ezio Trilogies. Since this would allow the narrative team more control in shaping the narrative since they knew everyone was going to experience it the exact same way.  Even if they retained the ""open world-ness"" of the current games, I think games like Yakuza Like a Dragon does an excellent job of keeping things both linear and open-world feeling by breaking things up into chapters and offering a slew of ""flashback sepia toned"" images that help players remember things that previously happened earlier in the game. This lack of direction, when it comes to the story, makes it hard to really connect to the story. Things have to be kept vague in order to be able to mesh with any other story mission that plays before it and it really creates an awful experience for players who might step away from the story for a while only to return and struggle to p/u where they left off. 

====


However, if Ubisoft continues to make games like this then I think offering some sort of list that shifts/changes depending on what you did already/what you plan on doing would be big for players who might need some help figuring out what order to do things and i'd take it a step further and recommend offering the ability to fast travel directly to the start of story missions as a way to help bridge this gap.

**Open worlds are fun but only up to a certain period of time. Having some sort of optional structure in place in the background just offers a bit of relief to players who might need a break from the world being so open.**","56","post"

"Alamoa20","2025-05-01","Hello, hi, really appreciate the work, guys. Thank you. Can't wait to see more. Here are some wild suggestions:

\- If you're adding an alarm system in the open world, please please consider adding social stealth for Naoe as well. I know this wont be a full on wanted system like Mirage, but adding a thin layer of town and city traversal challenge would do wonders. Have some outfits (servant, peasant) slow down detection, have it trigger social interactions with guards instead. Have them get suspicious of you by following you WITHOUT the detection meter, giving us a couple of choices if they catch up to us, let us bribe them, bring back blending stations like benches, market stalls...etc. Hey, you said wildest suggestions. I'm going all out. 

\- Add more varieties of random events that use the social interaction mechanic. Stranded folks that need a ride, thieves that can pickpocket you, that can pick pocket others (with the parkour update, we're gonna need more chases around towns, right?). There is a ton of scenarios that you can add to vary up exploration and world traversal. Lessen the amount of roaming Ronin in the world, instead have some of them show up as random call outs for a duel in towns and cities that also implement the social interaction system of accepting the duel or refusing and have occasional consequences for refusal, such as the Ronin calling their friends and jumping you anyway. Or even like, accepting the duel CAN lead to that ambush as well. ""Ronin can be like ""follow me, I know a good spot for a fight"", you follow and BAM three bandits or Ronin show up. 

\- Implement a function for the random camp sites in the world. I find these folks sitting in camp sites by fires, have them call out to me or something and have us sit and listen to stories about the world, about characters in the world(maybe expanding on some of the side targets like the Twisted Tree), some Yokai stories...etc.

\- A sumo minigame for Yasuke and a gambling mini-game for Naoe because we SERIOUSLY need stuff to do in cities and towns other than praying at shrines. The food vendors are literally just a button press and poof, codex entry. Turn that into an eating mini-game like the one in Star Wars Outlaws. That'd be awesome for immersion AND cultural identity of the setting. Gives off a tourist vibe that I adored in outlaws.

\- Please PLEASE lock some target board side targets. Let them only be initiated by the quest giver because some of them lose SOOOOO much context when you just stumble on to them. Like the Twisted Tree and Yokai quests. I run into these quests knowing NOTHING about who i'm killing or what I just ran into, while Yasuke and Naoe comment like they know everything and I feel so lost. A LOT of these stories have some awesome potential and don't get me wrong, stumbling on some side targets IS good, like the Godai Shinobi or the Yamabushi impostors(seriously, whoever had the idea of having one ambush you while you're doing an activity is a genius)

I'm so sorry, this is haphazardly written, I know, but I just think this game can become something amazing. This beautiful gorgeous world deserves more love and attention for its labors. Look, Assassins Creed Shadows is a flawed game, deeply in some departments but I've been a fan for so long now that an opportunity to give feedback and see it implemented is just too good to pass by. If you've read this far, thank you, truly. Can't wait to see what this game morphs into by the end of the year.","54","comment"
"Ubi-RealDude","2024-12-11",">In Shadows choice takes on many forms, impacting who we play as, and quest and other gameplay outcomes. In terms of the story of our league, we get to explore core themes like community and chosen family through choice since Naoe and Yasuke can choose who to recruit as allies and who to connect with as friends and lovers, either for a short, sweet time or longer term.

Which kinda puts you in a weird stop of i might aswell shouldve barged in with Yasuke and tenderized them all with a big fuck off stick and be done in half the time.

And then if you turn on one hit kill assassinate the game gear and therefore the grind of it becomes meaningless so the design of the game is out completely.

I can see *Shadows* doing well in the long run. Not only is word of mouth really positive so far* (aside from the Fandom Menace types and people who have a hyperbolic negative reaction to anything with Ubisoft on the cover), but there's the simple fact that it's a setting fans have been requesting for over a decade, feudal Japanese media in general is really popular, and samurai/ninjas (or at least the pop culture version of them) are cool. Up there with vikings, pirates and cowboys.

* of course, early WOM for *Valhalla* was positive too, but then the honeymoon period ended and it became one of the more divisive entries in the series. Guess we'll see, though so far *Shadows* seems to have addressed the common *Valhalla* criticisms. (Too much bloat, lousy stealth, etc.)","50","comment"
"TheHarryman01","2025-05-22","[Resident Evil: Village; World’s Greatest Dad] After the success of **Resident Evil 7: BIOHAZARD**, the public would be right to assume that Capcom would keep this train going and that the next game in the series would be just as fun and even scarier than the last. However, the public would only partially agree with that assumption. 

# Overview 

In 2017, Capcom released **Resident Evil 7: BIOHAZARD**. The game returned the series to its roots in survival horror after a couple of missteps from previous games. Upon release, it was met with critical acclaim, with people praising its “tense” and “unsettling” atmosphere. **Resident Evil** was back in full force, establishing itself as the definitive survival-horror series. With this success, what was Capcom going to follow up with? 

Enter **Resident Evil: Village** in 2021. This game was a bit confusing for fans. Sure, it was a lot of fun and still felt like a **Resident Evil** game. But the tonal switch was like the transition from the original trilogy to **Resident Evil 4**. The game still had its scary moments, but it was apparent that it was focusing more on the “action” gameplay than on the “horror” gameplay. We thought that **Resident Evil 7** was a sign that the series was going to delve deeper into the horror genre, so why are we back into the action genre? Like **Resident Evil 4**, though, this game makes it work and blends the two genres better than Resident Evil 5 or 6 did. 

# Why Am I Doing This? 

Ethan Winters returns as the main protagonist of this new entry. After the events of the Baker House Incident in Louisiana, Ethan and his wife Mia are placed under witness protection and moved to an undisclosed location in Europe. It isn’t just Ethan and Mia now too; the two of them welcomed their new bundle of joy into the world, Rosemary Winters.  

The game opens on a normal day in the Winters’ household. Mia is cooking dinner, and Ethan goes to put Rosemary to bed for the night. Breaking glass is then heard, and a bullet strikes Mia in the shoulder. Mia is then fired upon by more weapons while Ethan ducks and takes cover, wondering what the hell is happening. Chris Redfield then enters the house, knocking Ethan out and taking both him and Rosemary with Chris and his team. 

Ethan then wakes up after the truck transporting him and Rosemary crashes. With no sign of Rose anywhere nearby, Ethan treks off further into the snow. Ethan eventually stumbles upon the titular Village and is left to explore it whilst hearing the howling of wolves nearby. With no other options, Ethan is left to explore this Village and find Rosemary, no matter what it takes.  

# The Gameplay Loop 

Like **Resident Evil 7**, this game is entirely in the first-person, something not entirely normal for the series. Despite this, the game still feels like a **Resident Evil** game. All the ingredients are here: herbs, combining different items to make ammo or healing items, and a few puzzles here and there. But while **Resident Evil 7** channeled the energy of the first three games, **Resident Evil: Village** channeled **Resident Evil 4** in its gameplay style. You’re encouraged to make good use of your ammo, but the addition of The Duke as the merchant means that you buy more ammo should you ever run out. While you can’t roundhouse kick enemies like Leon did; after a successful guard, Ethan can shove enemies away, allowing the player to put some space between them and their attacker.  

Replacing the Molded from the previous entry are the Lycans. Now you may hear that and think of werewolves, but you couldn’t be more wrong. The lycans are strong, mutated humans that have been experimented on and kept out of the village. Compared to the zombies from previous Resident Evil entries, the lycans are a bit more unique in the fact that they’re able to move a lot faster than the zombies do. In addition to this, the lycans will be using weapons like machetes and bows and arrows against Ethan.  

I have no huge qualms about the gameplay of **Resident Evil: Village**. I thought that it succeeded in what it was trying to achieve. Most of my issues from **RE7** were resolved, Ethan can finally move faster than a snail, and all the weapons have some use. There is one gripe I do have about this game, though: all the enemies are complete sponges. Almost every enemy you come across will take at least half a clip of your pistol to kill, and that’s assuming you’re getting all headshots. Some enemies move slowly enough to get consistent headshots, but the lycans are always jumping back ‘n forth, sidestepping from left to right, it's incredibly difficult to get consistent headshots on them. Ammo is less of a concern in this installment, yes, but you still need to be conscious about it. I can’t be using all my shotgun ammo to take down common enemies when I could use it for the boss of the area.

"coolwali","2025-03-27","[I platinummed Assassin's Creed Rogue on the PS3]  Hello everyone. I recently platinummed Assassin's Creed Rogue on the PS3 and wish to talk about it. Fun fact, this is actually my first PS3 Platinum. I 100%-ed the game back in 2015 but never got around to platinumming it. I recently found my old PS3, saw the game was still inside that I was like 6 trophies off getting the Platinum so I went for it. According to PSNProfiles, it took me 9 years, 11 months, 1 weeks to platinum this game.


 

Most of the trophies in the game can be acquired naturally as you 100% the game. 100%ing the game in this case means going to every location and doing every objective or finding every collectible in those locations. There are trophies tied to that like ""Cartographer - Visit every location in the game "" and ""I'll take that - Capture all settlements"". Most of the trophies I missed in 2015 were ones that weren't necessary for getting 100% completion like ""Camper - Loot 20 supply camps"" and ""What's yours is mine - Loot 20 ship convoys"".  I looted around 10 or so in 2015 because I already had all the resources I needed by the 10 count. These were rather tedious to grind since they involved fast travelling to locations, hoping the thing had respawned and completing them. 

 

Ship Convoys were particularly annoying. At least for Supply Camps, they were static respawns so it was easy enough to wait for the ones at their locations to respawn so I could farm them out. But Ship Convoys are pseudo-random events. I looked up posts online and some said co-ordinates of where they tended to respawn but I had mixed success with these. The main issue appears to be that when these spawn, only that 1 exists and travels across the North Atlantic. So even if they spawned at the specified locations, they could have moved away by the time I came to investigate. My main approach ended up being Taverns as you can pay £200 at Taverns to get a chance to mark a Ship Convoy on your map. However, at the 17/20 mark, the game seemed to stop spawning them. Every Tavern I visited said ""there is no intel available come back later"". I did almost every other trophy while waiting for more to spawn.

 

I imagine this trophy would have been less annoying to get had I been consistently farming them throughout my playthrough rather than at the end. A similar case exists for the ""Freedom fighter - Free 300 British Prisoners of War"" trophy. The way this works is that a random event spawns where there is a prisoner ship guarded by 2 escort ships. The prisoner ship has 100 prisoners on it and any damage it takes (either from you or from its escorts) damages it and kills prisoners. To save the most amount of prisoners, you have to incapacitate the escorts as quickly as possible while minimizing the damage the prisoner ship receives. It's actually a pretty fun change of pace and challenge.

 

I was kicking myself because one of these Prisoner ships spawned while I was looking for a Convoy Ship and I sailed past it thinking I didn't need it. I could have saved myself the time. The most reliable way to get more Prisoner Ships to spawn, according to all the guides, is to Fast Travel to the Carin Morne location and do nothing for 20 minutes. Just put the controller down and wait 20 minutes and this forces a new Prisoner Ship to spawn. I did so and it worked and got that trophy. Like I said, I missed out on this one because 2015 me  didn't  feel the need to rescue more than 200 prisoners since he already had plenty of recruits.

 

I will praise the game for having a stats page that tracks everything you've done. Including stuff for the trophies so I didn't have to keep count myself. I wish more games had this even if there aren't trophies to benefit from. I love looking at my in-game stats. Even modern Ubisoft games have made this inconvenient as your stats are now on a separate Ubisoft Connect app that is so slow to load in-game. 


I also missed the ""Nap time - Put 5 enemies to sleep with a sleep grenade at the same time"" and ""Instant Vikings - Hit 5 enemies with a berserk grenade at the same time"" trophies because in my 2015 playthrough, I never found a scenario where 5 or more enemies were bunched up so closely together that the grenades would have gotten them. Fortunately, this was an easy one to get as one of the Supply Camps have a 5 man patrol I could easily hit with both grenades back to back and get these trophies. ""Smashing - Destroy 100 Ice bergs"" was another one I missed because in my 100% playthrough, I only destroyed around 56 Icebergs. But it took around 15 minutes or so to get the remaining. 

 

""Denied - Counter 15 air surprise attacks"", on the other hand, is a trophy that's annoying to get naturally but trivial if you know how to farm it. Since the protagonist Shay is a Templar being hunted by Assassins, it makes sense there would be Assassins hiding on rooftops waiting to get the drop on him and he'd have to be careful walking around. But in practis","47","post"

"Lurking_like_Cthulhu","2025-03-25","About 30 hours in myself and I feel the same way. I’ll just add that the combat from both Yasuke and Naoe’s sides is the best it’s ever been in the series IMO. On the highest difficulty you really get to experience each character’s strengths and weakness a lot better, and as a result they’re both satisfying different power fantasies.

Naoe’s squishiness works so well with her speed and agility, and Yasuke’s ability to parry unblockable attacks (with the right gear) and burst through walls like the Kool-Aid man is so refreshing after hours of getting killed in one or two hits as Naoe. The whole gameplay loop of scouting/ infiltrating enemy bases is so good in Shadows because when one approach starts feeling repetitive you can switch characters and do it all differently until you start craving the other play style again.","46","comment"
"Pricerocks","2024-12-29","[Playing every main game part 8: Unity] Assassin’s Creed Unity ushers in the series to a new generation of consoles, and the new possibilities that come with them. It’s a brave new world, and the sky is the limit. Or, more accurately, Notre Dame is the limit. Coming into this game, I knew it was highly controversial but I’ve seen a decent bit of love for the game on this sub so I was cautiously optimistic. Unity boldly overhauls the series, but with this level of change comes a level of risk that it won’t land right. I’m sorry to say that risk came true, at least for me.

I finished this game with around 40% on the progress tracker, on Xbox Series X.

Obviously, spoiler warnings for Unity and a bit of Rogue below.

##**The Gameplay**

I have a lot to say about this one so let me get the quicker notes out of the way— visually, this game is by far the best the series has ever looked. You see bigger crowds while randomly walking around then you even saw in other games’ pre-rendered cutscenes. The first time you synchronize in this game is a massive shock. And although I’m becoming very tired of these games changing the control scheme in **every single game** I felt that Unity’s setup was among the best.

While the three key pillars of the series, parkour, stealth, and combat, remain at the game’s heart, each has been reworked from the ground up. Some of these changes are good, some are weak, and some straight up don’t work.

###Parkour
First off, let’s talk about the parkour. Unity’s parkour seems to be built around one important design goal: Don’t let the player accidentally jump to their deaths. This is achieved a few different ways: Adding new dedicated up/down parkour buttons to ensure the player is moving vertically how they want to, removing most ejects & stationary jumps, and some fine tuning to movement to ensure you stay “on track” as you move. I saw a lot of hype around this game’s parkour and some videos of Arno busting some crazy moves, but I think those videos were meticulously routed out ahead of time because in my gameplay he occasionally did something flashy but not usually. The new vertical controls are nice, especially the controlled descent which is something I never even realized I wanted. However, there is noticeable hand-holding. Try jumping off any roof to your death and you’ll probably land on a tiny wire or miraculously launch yourself to the other side of the street to catch the lowest ledge on the building opposite you. Also, climbing feels slow in this game and there are taller buildings than any game before it. Overall, it still flows pretty well but sometimes the training wheels are a bit too intrusive. 

###Stealth
Stealth in this game straight up does not play like any other AC game. Redone from the ground up, several mechanics have been changed and some outright removed. Perhaps most noticably, Eagle Vision is now more of a ping system than a toggleable tracking system. You can’t mark enemies anymore, but you can see them through walls any time eagle vision is active, which seems a fair trade. You also don’t see enemies on the minimap without either crouching or being in eagle vision, which means I got into all sorts of trouble I would have effortlessly avoided in any other game. I don’t hate the new system but still prefer the old one.

Crouching and a “hard” cover system have been added. By hard cover I mean that you snap to dedicated cover spots, as opposed to the other games’ “soft” cover systems where you walked up to a corner and knew you were in cover when your character would lean out around it slightly. I personally felt the new system was a little too rigid; I sometimes couldn’t get into or out of cover quickly, and the inability to swap cover around a corner (moving around a table for example) put me in a few sticky situations. I am very happy to have a crouching mechanic however, I’ve wanted one the whole time I’ve played the series.

The sleep and firecracker darts from Unity were removed outright. Sure you have cherry bombs to use as lures, but I found them wildly inconsistent, either drawing no one’s attention or far too much. Since whistling was also removed, this left me with zero viable ways to lure enemies. I had a total of zero successful uses of the beserk blade, the few times I tried it, it instantly aggroed everything in the area and didn’t even affect my target. I was left with the gun, the Phantom Blade (admittedly pretty good) and smoke grenades as my equipment (the others didn’t even sound useful so I didn’t unlock them.) I also tried the disguise perk with mixed results; it wasn’t always clear why I couldn’t disguise in a certain situation and there seemed to be 0 warning before the disguise dropped. When it did work, it was pretty cool.

While playing Unity I came to have the opinion that the stealth in this game was designed with interior gameplay in mind. Virtually every story assassination has you sneaking into and around a building to get to you","46","post"
"JackDiMaze","2025-05-16","Completly agree man! Had to force myself to at least see the ending. Been an AC fan since the first one, played all of them multiple times. Shadows is by far the most boring and repetitive AC since the very first one (the repetitive part, I love 1). Valhalla feels full of life and possiblities next to this. I truly can't understand how people are praising it. Like you said, the best part of the story is the beginning, after that it all blends together, no memorable set piece, no memorable target, location, anything. And the map is all the same. Truly, can't understand how many people are loving it. This is the perfect example of why we should not listen to the crowds and make our own conclutions.","44","comment"
"SilveryDeath","2025-01-10","Makes sense when you look at how stacked February is, even after AC moved:

"scottmapex1234","2025-08-26","It’s the most boring AC game world in my opinion, by quite a margin. 

It’s beautiful to look at sure , but it’s such a huge slog to get around the copy paste environments. Even Valhalla had more spectacular vistas & had the boat to give more options in exploration. 

Shadows replaced Valhallas bloat with its own bloat , but somehow it feels like it has nothing to actually do in the game? Yeah there is a lot of assassinations to do , fair enough. But the game world has no business being so oversized for just that.","43","comment"
"MagGamer","2025-01-30","[AC Shadows has 13 Black Box Missions according to several reviewers, these will tell us how good shadows is as it's AC games at its best IMO - share your thoughts] The word around AC shadows is there will be 13 or so black box missions which are what I believe AC games should focus on so this is good news. The bad news is at the moment there is no way to replay them but a developer said that you will have a chance before starring the black box missions to save the game so you can always come back to that. A prompt saying are you ready for big mission is when you save. 

Also the developers took notes from community where was asking that black box missions are replayable. This might be a big ask and might take devs time to find a way but will be perfect if they add the feature which use to be in Ac games. Keep the hope alive. 


Black box missions for any new players is a big mission what has many opportunities to get the job done like a sandbox assassination mission designed for AC stealth and more. I bring this up to community for a couple reasons. 

Does anyone know how many black box missions are in the older games? Would love a list. As for the missions themselves to me this is how you measure how good the game design and ac games theme is. Think back to unity which has some top tier ones.  What are your favorites also?","43","post"
"bestanonever","2025-01-08","[Bestanonever’s 2024 Patient Game Of The Year Awards ] My name is Bestanonever and just like [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/18tmtgp/bestanonevers_2023_patient_game_of_the_year_awards/), I want to commemorate my year in gaming…with a twist! I’m going to focus on the achievements of the best games I’ve played in 2024, all separated into neat little categories, celebrating the best in gaming from all the games I’ve finished last year.

First, the numbers: in 2024, I’ve finished a total of 27 games, with two of them being impatient, so only 25 qualify, plus I have 3 games from last year that I can finally mention (**Resident Evil 4 Remake**, **Remnant 2** and **Sea of Stars**). I also dropped 8 other games. While my total number of played titles is lower than last year’s insane 40 games score, the devil is in the details. Two games easily took a quarter of my time. They were **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** and **Cyberpunk 2077 (with Phantom Liberty DLC)**, with each of them lasting about 180 hours.

If this year had a theme, was the high number of [indies ](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1gysh61/my_indie_year_in_review/)I’ve finally played. A third of my played games (9 games) and 5 of my dropped ones were indies. Which is the most indie gaming I’ve done in a single year in a very long time.

Now, without further ado, I introduce Bestanonever’s Patient Game Of The Year Awards, starting with…

# Best Role-Playing Game

The Nominees are:

**Cyberpunk 2077 (with Phantom Liberty):** you have so many ways to build your character. You can be a silent stealthy hacker, or a crazy ninja using a Katana with slow-mo or a brutish unstoppable tank with blunt weapons or more. There are also story options and multiple endings.

**Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition**: options galore. While the interface is clunky, you have so many ways to be either evil or a good guy and your party composition even changes according to your alignment. Jaheira best girl. Minsc and his space hamster, best boys.

**Tales of the Abyss**: a classic JRPG with quite a bit of fame behind it. Progression is traditional and very nice, the real time combat is fun. There is a lot of optional missable content. Some powers and skills stop coming up in the last quarter, unless you use a guide.

**Knights of the Old Republic**: another classic and a good year to play Bioware games. I was a knight of the light side and you can build your character in multiple ways and decide the fate of people your own way, one lightsaber swing at a time. Never saw the big plot twist coming (loved it).

**Sea of Stars** (From 2023): very beautiful art and excellent music. Mediocre story but the gameplay, the mini-game and art are good enough to play it all.

And the winner is:

**Tales of the Abyss**: I loved all the main characters. The character progression of Luke, the protagonist, is the best part of the game. Grinding and exploring the towns is very traditional for the genre but feels like coming back to your hometown. Not revolutionary at all, but always cozy. I’ll be playing more Tales of games from now on after this one.

# Best Action-Adventure Game

**Doom Eternal**: it’s not as easy to play as **Doom 2016** but once you get into it, you can’t get enough of this adrenaline-fueled adventure. The only thing they fear is the Marauder.

**Cyberpunk 2077 (with Phantom Liberty)**: another nomination for this one! The FPS feel is closer to looter shooters like Borderlands and it plays well and fast. Best gameplay loop from any CD Projekt game, so far. Using Sandevistan’s slowmo to mow down five guys in a flash makes you feel like your very own David Martinez.

**Resident Evil 4 Remake** (played in 2023): it’s just as good as the original was, with a more modern and serious presentation. A fantastic good time.

**Bayonetta**: stylish, fast and fun gameplay in the vein of Devil May Cry. Loved the irreverent characters and the fun (albeit nonsensical, at times) universe. Color palette could use some variety.

And the winner is:

**Doom Eternal**: It took longer than Doom 2016 to click, but once it did, I felt almost as unstoppable. Plus, it was always fun to conquer each and every level and discover all the secrets. Next DOOM, please.

# Best Audio Design

**Starcraft 2: The Complete Trilogy (full review** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1cti27x/starcraft_2_complete_trilogy_from_the_point_of/)**)**: I always loved the voice acting and post-edition in Blizzard Games and this one was top-notch in that regard. Also, the audio mix for the real time battles, the units shouting their taunts and the cutscenes made the whole thing a sublime aural mix.

**L.A. Noire**: excellent environmental and small elements sounds, plus some damn fine voice acting (with the funny faces). The notebook handling, pen writing, car driving sounds so authentic and detailed in a game where the small stuff is always important. Transport","43","post"
"Enalye","2025-03-27","I'm not very far into the game at all, maybe like 10 hours, but I get the impression that Naoe's village is a *shinobi* village, aka a village where they have ninja families and ninja culture. This matches up with real history, where the region of Iga (Where Naoe's Village is) is where shinobi originated, and they started selling their services as spies and infiltrators to high bidders, so the general public knowing about them makes some amount of sense.

 I feel like the Assassin thing is only her father and that master Sanduyu guy so far, like another layer of secrets on top of their general shinobi family legacy thing. The other randoms in her village and ikki are not assassins. I could be totally wrong, but that's what I'm picking up from my playthrough.","42","comment"
"zoobatt","2025-01-10","I'd also like to think it's the latter. If it were the former, the game already looks good enough on the surface to get sales. In other words, it doesn't need lipstick. If they knew they had a pig, they'd just release it because delaying just costs them more money.

This strikes me as them knowing that Shadows' success is vital for the company's future, and they're willing to take financial hits from delays to release the best product they can. They seem to be investing heavily into changing their company image after Outlaws' underwhelming launch.","42","comment"
"DemiGabriel","2025-04-19","Delaying the game was what saved Shadows. 


If it had come out when the ""hate campaign"" was at its peak, it would undoubtedly have resulted in something negative for the game and for Ubisoft. 


The reality is that it doesn't matter if 10 people hate a game or a company, there will always be 10,000 who didn't even have a clue and just bought the game. ","42","comment"
"United_Department_71","2025-03-20","I loved ac origins, didn’t play odyssey, and played like 30-40 hours of Valhalla but didn’t finish it.

After about 2 hours in I am really enjoying shadows. The cutscenes are pretty long but it is the prologue so that’s expected to get some exposition done. The fact alone that there is significant motion capture makes me think that there was a lot more effort put into the story. Excited to see more.

I’m playing on hard mode and really enjoying the combat. It’s quick (I imagine the enemies will attack faster as the game continues) and tbh parrying with Japanese weapons always feels cool. It feels less hulk smash then Valhalla. 

Stealth felt really good, if like me, you wanted to play just for the ninja/shinobi fantasy, I think you’ll like it 

So far, solid, feels like they actually care, and I am excited to continue playing","41","comment"
"hawkian","2025-03-19","It's from the interpolated review of Mirage that they included in the middle of the Shadows review... just an error on the part of copying I think. Here's the equivalent conclusion about Shadows: 

>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip.","41","comment"
"Roman64s","2025-03-19","People just want Ubisoft games to auto-fail, nothing new. Even if AC Shadows was GOTY worthy, they'd still find a way to complain. It has become cool to shit on Ubisoft, most of the people complaining and doomposting about the scores being mid were never going to play the game in the first place.

Combine the Ubisoft hate train + the political hate train, you are guaranteed to see people be ass about the game even if it is good. But ultimately, all that matters is if **you** enjoy the game and what it offers.

I've seen reviewers praise Starfield to no end and when I played it, it was a solid 5/10. I've seen reviewers praise CP2077 to no fucking end and we all know how that turned out.","40","comment"
"StatisticianJolly388","2025-03-19","I consider myself a mild fan of Assassin's Creed. I quite enjoyed my time with Black Flag and Syndicate.

But the games have become so gargantuan that even when I start out liking them (Odyssey) I straight up resent them by the end.

Not to mention, Ubisoft has trained me that the games will be on sale for $10 within 18 months. 

Valhalla, which I obtained for free, has been sitting on my PS5 hard drive for at least a year, untouched. Why would I pay $70-$90 for Shadows?","40","comment"
"[deleted]","2025-05-12","Switching between Naoe and Yasuke should have been as fluid as switching to your eagle, in past releases, with a cooldown, from release. Both of them should have companion abilities for the other: Naoe assassinates from a distance with kunai. Yasuke charges, breaking doors, then does a cleaving attack. When not playing one, the other waits nearby: Naoe on the rooftops, Yasuke sitting outside walls/moats meditating.


Would like the economy tweaked, the hideout expanded, new levels and perks, and more reason to use it; e.g. buffs at shrine, temple, tea house, sleep, defend against raids that will deplete resources if left unchallenged. Or quests, minigames. 


A sleep feature to pass 8 hours and gain a buff, and a meditate feature.


Mounted combat. Mounted assassinations. ","40","comment"
"[deleted]","2025-03-19","Not just this, but I think people forget with the exception of AC2, Brotherhood, and Black Flag, AC games have never been critical darlings - the likes of AC3, Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla have pretty much all averaged out as 8/10's, with Unity, Syndicate, and Mirage all being closer to 7's 

If Shadows is getting 8's then it's basically as good as the majority of Assassin's Creed games.","40","comment"
"Patenski","2025-01-13","[Discovering Soulslikes, challenging Platformers, Puzzles and some variety here and there, my 2024 recap] Hello! while this is my first post in here, I have been reading this subreddit for quite a long time, and I have to say [r/patientgamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/) have easily become my favorite gaming community in any social media platform, the community in here is amazing, sharing their passion for videogames in an extensive manner and discussing in a civil way sharing a lot of different points of view, my props to the users in this community and the mods.

One of my objectives for this 2025 is improving my English, and what better than doing it while writing and sharing my thoughts on one of my favorites hobbies since I have memory, videogames. So here it is, a list of the games I enjoyed this past year:

***Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time (2020):***

I'm a huge fan of the *Crash Bandicoot* franchise, and Crash 4 IAT totally delivered as a spiritual sequel for the original trilogy developed by Naughty Dog. This game offers tight precision and time-based platforming along with beautiful visuals and in-level specific gimmicks in the form of masks that give Crash special abilities to affect the way you traverse the levels.

This game has become my favorite of the franchise, Toys for Bob definitely had the most experienced and veteran part of the fanbase in mind while making this game, and it shows by its high difficulty and the amount of content and challenges it throws at you. So, while I really recommend this game, be mindful that it will be a challenging experience, I have seen divided opinions about the difficulty by the online community.

***Outer Wilds: Echoe of the Eye (2021):***

I played *Outer Wilds* some time ago and absolutely loved it and have never experience something like it again, I was really pondering on how the developers would expand on their ""knowledge metroidvania"" formula of the base game in their DLC, and I have to say I was left completely impressed, not only because they were able to maintain the high quality of their puzzles and the in-world narrative that gets developed as you solve them, but they were successful in adding an unexpected element that made the experience of playing this fantastic game even more exciting: *fear.*

If you haven't played this game I can't recommend it enough, it makes for a personalized experience since the puzzles and secrets to unravel can be tackled from any direction, no two playthroughs are the same, grab the base game along its DLC for the ultimate experience, and go blind on it, there's nothing like it.

***Pokémon Alpha Sapphire (2014):***

Earlier in 2024, there were a lot of news about Nintendo going pretty hard against the emulation of its systems, not only they were quite aggressive on Yuzu, the emulator of its current console the Switch, but they also forced others to be taken down, Citra, an emulator of the 3Ds and (I think) Dolphin, a Wii emulator also suffered the consequences of the lawsuits from the great N.

With all the buzz and having just bought a pretty good cellphone, decided to download Citra, I'm not really a Nintendo type of gamer so I was pretty excited to see all the titles I could discover. At the end, my incursion into the emulation and 3DS world was quite short, I just tried two games, *New Super Mario Bros. 2 (2012)* that I didn't finish, and I also played *Pokémon Alpha Sapphire (2014).* This was my first Pokémon game experience, like many, I grew up watching the anime so I'm quite familiar with its universe and I specifically decided for Alpha Sapphire since it had Treecko, my favorite Pokémon when I was a kid.

I find the Pokémon game experience while simple, quite charming, building your team along the journey and challenging trainers in the different cities was my comfy place while commuting. I really got attached to my Sceptile, Swallow, Mightyena, Rampardos, Flygon, Sharpedo, Ninetales and Glalie.

***Sonic Generations (2011):***

I have an Xbox Series X, one of its main features is the backwards compatibility with extras like fps and resolution boosts. At the end of 2023 I finally played *Sonic Unleashed (2007)* like it was intended and got impressed by how ahead of its time that game was. This time was the turn of Sonic Generations.

Sonic Generations combines two ways of playing Sonic, the original 2D platformer scroller and the 3D stage with fast paced platforming that heavily relies on quick decisions and reactions, I really liked the former and what the Sonic community has defined as the ""boost era"" of Sonic, name that comes from the main mechanic in these 3D stages of activating a speed boost that consumes Sonic's energy and serves to travel even faster and to destroy obstacles.

I'm not really a Sonic fan, so the 2D sections were my first introduction to the classic gameplay and I really liked it and even found them more challenging than the 3D stages that sometimes feel like an ""o","40","post"
"CriesAboutSkinsInCOD","2025-02-13","Digital Foundry and Alex will get to the bottom of all of this and tells you what is what once they have the full game.

Even with upscaling 4K and 60fps on console sounds pretty good considering Shadows is a big open beautiful game with changing Seasons and will have some form of RTGI.

One thing tho is that Nvidia still is king with their upscaling techs and years ahead of everyone while consoles are run on AMD and other upscaling techs.

Hopefully Ubisoft Anvil engine is well optimized here for both consoles and PCs. I'm a PC Gamer with a recently updated gaming rig.","38","comment"
"gonGonnaAnt","2024-12-20","[Rating the games I played this year] Hey I found these threads interesting so I thought I'd give it a go. I will only include games I played for a significant amount of time.

My rating system: a 9/10 or above game is a masterpiece, a 8/10 game is very good and a 7/10 game is good. I usually drop games pretty fast if I don't like them so there will likely be no games 6/10 or lower on my list.. I won't rate games I played too little of.

**Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp 8.5/10**  
I played the second one when I was pretty young, as well as Dual Strike and Days of ruin when they came out. I loved them but this kind of game was pretty tough when you're young. I went in with no expectation, it's rare I like old games as much as when I was younger. The game is really great, lots of fun. I love the art and the basic cartoony vibe of the campaigns. I alternate between the campaigns and the war room maps, which are very fun. I don't usually like turn base strategy games (only Into the breach in recent memory, which I loved) but I recommand this one for sure.

**Braid 7.5/10**  
Fun game. I don't get the deep/smart stuff in that game, I mostly have no idea what people are talking about when they discuss the themes, the philosophy and all that. Not the most fun I had with puzzles but I usually drop puzzle games pretty fast and I finished that game, so they were fun and gripping enough. I did everything except the stars (I did not find a single one).

**Cuphead 8/10**  
DNF. I completed at least 50% of a playthrough. Bosses were not that difficult, I killed a couple of tough ones like the green dragon, the big red bird and the bee (don't get me wrong, they were hard. but you see clear progress, they are very well designed). Boss rush games are not for me though, they're too stress/tilt inducing. Although interestingly enough, the most tilting levels by far were the ones without bosses. The game quality is obvsiously very high.

**Dave the diver 8/10**  
DNF, I played for 25 hours, I unlocked the magma (the zone below the ice one) zone and stopped. I've seen complaints on Reddit that the game goes to shit once you start dealing with sea people. I think that's a bit harsh, you reached the sea people very early in the game lol. But yeah I get their point. It's all about the fun of the gameplay loop and the sea people did not help with that.

I ended up liking much more the restaurant sim part then I would have thought. The puzzle and story sections were usually a bit boring. I did not care for the bosses. They throw constantly new stuff at you.. which is mostly fine and fun tbh, but not all of it (for example the Stardew farming stuff). I could talk about pros and cons of the diving part but that would take a while. Mostly not enough random generated stuff I guess, runs below are too similar. Great game until it wasn't.

**Dead island 2 7.5/10**  
DNF, I played for 19 hours. Everytime this game is mentionned on Reddit, I read that ""it's a solid 7-8/10 game, pure fun"" or something similar. When I started, I thought that assesment was not fair, the game felt and looked great. I loved the first zone. I would have prefer more ""mysteries/puzzle"" though, meaning that I wanted to figure out how to open those lock doors in the big mansions. But most of them were locked until you reach specific missions (I still had fun trying to solve those self-imposed mysteries). I did not like the other zones as much but the first one was just so good. The story is serviceable, I love the the graphics and the UI and how things are written on screen (like a Quantin Tarantino movie). The voice acting was good, the combat too, the systems too. It felt like a high quality game. Ultimately I got bored though, not my type of game.

**Dying light 8/10**  
DNF, I played for 20 hours. Did a couple of missions in the new city. I almost did not stop playing. It's not my type of game but I was pleasantly surprised. Parkour was very well made and fun. I usually get tired of an open world gameplay loop at some point. Everything was fun and well made, side quests, etc. Story was good enough but the MC is boring (he also becomes the hero and the most reliable person of the city after like 5 minutes ?). It got to the point where I didn't feel like loading up the game. I played DL before DI2... I suspect the ratings would be switched if it was the other way around.

**Enderal: Forgotten Stories 8/10**  
DNF, I played for 50 hours. Similar to Dying light I guess.. gameplay loop was fun, until I did not feel like playing. Story was good but not as great as people say online (to be fair, I rarely like the story in a game). Very high quality mod, it feels like high production. Lots of fun in the dungeons, especially in the first 30 hours because I hadn't played Skyrim in forever. Word of advice: the balancing at the start of the game is terrible, you will die a lot. It gets better very quickly though. Oh and the best thing by far about that game is that it is a o","38","post"
"GenericReditUserName","2025-03-22","*\* In describing my journey in Japan I will talk about some of the major elements of the 500-year-old Sengoku Era that may or may not reveal anything about the plot of the video game. Mild centuries old history spoilers may be described. If you dont want to read any history spoiler stuff don't read it but I will avoid talking about anything game specific concerning our dual protagonists just the history that we already know. I hope anyone who comments will be courteous to do the same.*

I decided to begin my Japan trip in Osaka & it's where my plane landed. The castle was literally the very first thing on my to do list to visit. Before my visit I had known of the Sengoku Era but not much, just some broader things about it. I was in for a real treat as the castle interior has been transformed into an actual modern history museum dedicated to it and to its founder Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Inside one of the castle floors are multiple hologram panels each dedicated to a chapter of Toyotomi's life. It's there where I learned he was a dirt poor peasant who got on Oda's radar just like Yasuke was by being a noteworthy individual. Toyotomi became Oda's sandal bearer and during the winter he would put Oda's sandals inside his clothes to warm them up with his body heat. This made Oda realize Toyotomi had potential & just how right Oda's instincts were about him. Toyotomi was a brilliant military strategist whom served Oda faithfully & it was Toyotomi who ended up succeeding him after the Honnō-ji Incident. Toyotomi has one of the most iconic Samurai helments of all. A brilliant head piece that looks like a golden peacock of the suns bright rays. Inside the castle there was a photo op area where you can put on a replica of his helmet and take your picture with it. So many kids loved doing this. It was Toyotomi who dies at the start of the TV Show ""Shogun"" that leads to the rise of Japan's 3rd great unifier in Tokagawa Iyeasu. It was Tokagawa Iyeasu who brought an end to the Sengoku Era & began the Edo Period. However he did this by breaking his promise to Toyotomi because it was Toyotomi's son who was supposed to inherit the leadership position. So although we typically consider the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 as the close to the Sengoku Era & the rise of the Edo Period, there was still one more conflict to resolve. In 1615 Tokagawa Iyeasu betrayed his promise to Toyotomi and sacked the castle killing Toyotomi's son and burning it to the ground. This would be the 1st time out of 4 times Osaka Castle would be destroyed. During another civil conflict at the end of the Edo Period in 1868 it was once again captured & destroyed. 53 years later just as Japan began its prelude to the Second World War by invading Manchuria the castle was again rebuilt in 1931. This is currently its final form with some restoration throughout the decades.

On my first day I arrived 1 hour before they closed so I went a there for a 2nd time the following day to get my fill. Funny enough it rained a lot during my 2nd time there and while I was taking my in game pictures it was also raining inside the game. Somehow rain never seems to leave me alone when I visit Osaka Castle. I had a lovely ride home in a cab on my way back to the APA hotel I was staying at. When I escaped the rainstorm and jumped into the cab I was just telling my driver what I had learned in the museum about Toyotomi. Seeing my interest he proceeded to give me a cute and short history lesson. He put his hands together a CM apart and said this is Oda Nobunaga, he than widened his hands half a foot apart and said this is Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then he opened his hands up all the way as if he was going to give a hug and said, ""This is Tokagawa Iyeasu"". It was so cool having a Japanese person showcase in such a simple way the lasting power, legacy, and winner of the Sengoku Era that Tokagawa Iyeasu was. Then something else that impressed me occurred. When we arrived at the APA hotel I realized it was the wrong one I had mistakenly told him to drop me off at. It was only my 2nd day in Japan and I learned what so many tourists eventually learn and that is that APA hotels populate every street corner in the country to a comical degree. There can be 3 of them on one block. The one where I mistakenly asked to be returned to was a good distance from the one I wanted to go. Upon realizing my mistake I apologized to the driver and offered to hire him again to take me to the right one and he refused to bill me. ""Service!"" he said, ""No, Service, Service!"" he insisted. They do things old fashioned in Japan and I could see on his paper ledger that the trip he logged for me was the most expensive thus far of his entire day and he didn't want me to pay any more. He took me to the right hotel at no extra cost even though it was during afternoon rush hour traffic in Osaka. My cab driver was awesome.","37","comment"
"Cyshox","2025-10-25","Maybe we played different games, but I found GoY even more monotonous than AC:Shadows. Both just copy-paste the gameplay loop of previous titles but at least AC:Shadows has like 2-3 times more types of activities. Both GoT & GoY get so repetitive real quick. Everything you possibly can do, you'll discover in the first 3-4 hours. Then you just repeat similar activities & quests till the credits roll. For me, it was a huge disappointment, and I'm surprised only a few reviewers mentioned the lack of gameplay variety.","37","comment"
"The_Last_Minority","2025-03-25","My only gripes with it are fairly nitpicky: 

First, it is good enough that I'm comparing it to a more handcrafted echelon of game and it comes up short. Specifically, its conversational animations are not all motion-capture, which makes a lot of side characters feel stiff and lifeless. On most Assassin's Creed games that isn't an issue, but the world is immersive enough and the gameplay fluid enough that I find myself slipping into a RDR2 mindset only to be jerked out of it by a clearly procedural lip-sync.

Also, as someone with a decent grasp of the Japanese language, there is some weirdness with the immersive mode voice-over compared to the subtitles. For instance, in a mission that needs a fake name I chose ""Shigure"" as my pseudonym in the prompt and Naoe introduced herself as ""Sen"" (Which was not one of the three options provided). Both of these are fine names for the task at hand, it's just odd that the discrepancy exists. Similarly, there have been a couple of situations where the text, in my opinion, undersells or underexplains something where a simple word swap or additional parenthetical explanation would work. 

My suspicion is that the subtitles are based on the English script, which was given an internal pass for consistency but not checked against the Japanese one. It would be extremely easy to fix: None of the things I noticed couldn't be solved with simple line edits to the subtitles.","37","comment"

"JeagerXhunter","2025-02-12","I think people should read the article. This comment seems to be directed at how you decided to play the open world. Both characters will still be getting their own stories and missions. This was pretty much highlighted in this quote: 

""They get individual introductions and then they get their own questline also. Let's say [for] Naoe, a personal questline cannot be played by Yasuke and those are two distinct things. But the core of the game can be pick your character and the game adapts.""

Why are we forgetting this was a concern of the community a few weeks ago because Yasuke can't parkour all that well. With people saying that because of his inability to parkour you'll miss stuff. This seems to be the devs way of trying to answer that concern imo.","37","comment"

"westonsammy","2025-03-27","I think my biggest problem with the game is how disjointed and kind of off the pace of the storytelling and gameplay is. As someone who hasn’t touched an AC game in 10 years, it really feels like I’m being dropped into the middle of the second season of a show and stuff is happening but I’ve missed the setup and explanation.

Like Naoe’s father and entire village apparently being assassins. This is treated as a given fact by all characters, it’s not a secret, but the game never outright states it either. I only know that they’re assassins because I’ve played an AC game and recognize the blade and symbol. But if this is your first AC, you’ll have no idea what any of that means and it’s seemingly never actually explained to you.

So much of the story is like this and it’s just weird.","36","comment"
"ProfN42","2025-09-25","[Just finished Mirage. Overall, fantastic! (Late review and some thoughts)] \*FULL SPOILERS\*

I went into Mirage VERY dubious after the steadily dropping quality (IMO) of the games since the dawn of the ""RPG era"" (Origins-Odyssey-Valhalla). You've heard all the complaints before - open world Ubibloat, lack of clear and character driven plot, dull attempts at a modern day story. To those common complaints I would add my frustration at turning the game into an RPG level up system with loot drops. But I had good recommendations from trusted friends that Mirage sought to return the game to basics. I heard: it has a shorter, more focused story and is more about being an assassin. This is welcome since, of course, neither Kassandra nor Eivor were even Assassins (or Hidden Ones), and both of them even let their games' Big Bads off the hook! I was also intrigued by learning more about Basim, by far the most interesting and believably-motivated character to appear in the AC franchise since probably... idk, Elise de la Serre I guess? I was disappointed to hear we wouldn't be getting the magnificent Carlo Rota back to voice him, but philosophical about it - voicing a VG main character is a large time commitment and they probably couldn't afford him, plus his voice is a touch old to play young Basim. I was hopeful about increased stealth and parkour, but knowing that Mirage started life as a Valhalla DLC I didn't let my hopes get too high on these points. Overall, while I have my nitpicks, I am walking away already thinking about starting a NG+. By comparison, at no point have I ever \*considered\* a replay of Odyssey or Valhalla.

Basim's story is resonant and compelling, continuing the recent trend in AC where characters find the Assassins to be a bit morally grey - but, importantly WITHOUT falling into the Unity-era nonsense of ""they're both equally bad"". The Order/Templars are back to being what they're meant to be - VILLAINS. Roshan, voiced by the fantastic Shohreh Agdashloo (albeit not in her greatest recent role), is believable as a questionable leader doing what she thinks is best in a tough situation. (How cool was it that they gave her the surname ""Bint La'Ahad"" (Daughter of No One)? Wonderful confirmation of fantheory that this is a common surname given to children raised within the Brotherhood, or those who have rejected former family ties, as she did.) Roshan's decision (to conceal Basim's suspected Isu heritage from him) is arguably wrong without straying into cartoonish, unreasonable, or evil; compare to Achilles's mystifying decision to reject accountability for the Lisbon quake, which drove Shay's otherwise completely preventable defection. Her crucial line of dialogue floored me with how well it grapples with the issue of the Sages and how to integrate them: ""Return to us - no more than a man, but no less than our brother"". Basim's insistence on being more than human, on his specialness, completes the other side of the coin from Eivor's humbler response to Odin: ""...everything else"". Sure, we can conceptualize it as his Loki-half, Nehal, tricking him - but really he's only tricking himself. Nehal has no power to make him do anything he doesn't want to, after all. Basim falls to his own pride and hurt feelings, not by any force - which, perfectly, are the exact flaws that caused Loki to betray the Aesir. Finally, I appreciated the elimination of most dialogue ""options"", which in Odyssey and Valhalla almost never led to any interesting or impactful differences in outcomes, and thus felt like a huge waste of time. Mirage dispenses with this bullshit and just focuses on telling Basim's story.

If anything, I wish we had had more focus on the mystery of Basim's nature, on the appearances of the Djinni and Nehal. The revelation that Nehal was never more than the titular Mirage is well handled - at some point in the game I think someone even mentions the concept of Fata Morgana, a kind of mirage that can appear above the ocean or desert, but which is also linked to the trickster fairy queen Morgan le Fay in Arthurian legend, linking deftly to Loki's future involvement in post-Arthurian England while foreshadowing Nehal's reveal. Having gone into the game of course already knowing about Basim's future, and having already been spoiled about Nehal's nature, it was fun watching all the scenes where only Basim ever talks to her or directly notices her. It's sometimes played up a bit too much that she's this master thief that can infiltrate anywhere... There's a great moment when he looks at and speaks to Nehal right after defeating Roshan, and we see Roshan look at where ""Nehal"" is standing and then back to him with an air of confusion and suspicion. It was perhaps a bit too obvious and ""Sixth Element""-y, but I still loved that they built moments like that in, so that they would be there on replay in NG+ to add more depth to the story. The best part of it by far is the psychological trick of ""Nehal"" killing Cali","36","post"
"TomTheJester","2025-03-23","Honestly Quebec nailed it. Hexe could blow it out of the water and keep Montreal as the “main” studio for the franchise, but at this point Ubi Quebec have a solid track record with Syndicate, Odyssey and now Shadows. Each game drastically builds on the last.

"Tartarus_Champion","2025-03-23","I love this game!


Tight rope fail, leap of fail on Yasuke = pure comedy!


I love Yasuke, love his story, love his personality. He's a beautiful dope sometimes, but mostly a raging bull in a tea shop!


Naoe or as I call her now, Meowe is the business Ninja. I've been longing for a Tenchu game since Wrath of Heaven, and you guys got that feel just right. She's a wrecking ball too in her own right.


The combat is phenomenal. I can't say enough good things about how great it feels. The only issue I have is drawing my ranged weapon with Yasuke, but I have adapted to it. I just had to pick my moment to change weapons to my bow for anti sniper combat. It's great. It's all great. 


The music is great too. It's reminding me of 47 Ronin or some Quentin Tarantino flick. It's fun.

"B_Kuro","2025-10-25","These changes/additions look awesome. At the same time I am kind of sad because in my experience AC Shadows itself its its biggest enemy to that being a massive improvement. I love the design of stealth (on max difficulty) and traversal (especially with these changes) for Naoe in shadows but the world itself (as true to reality as it might be) makes traversal really limited and repetitive. 

50-70% of the map is filled with nothing/nature and you basically can't traverse any it by design (sliding down hills, basically no climbing on any rock wall that isn't marked by yellow paint). Its clear they just intend for you to walk along roads so you can encounter Ronin/random bandits,...

Sadly the cities are also basically all made up of story buildings with little variance so there isn't much to traverse there either. The biggest exception would be castles which mostly are the same layout and really don't do any justice to this intricate traversal either. The examples given with the directive grab are nice and all but are really pointless. They show completely emptied out castles (otherwise the enemies would instantly get alert anyway) and the place you saw Naoe land on really wasn't offering further options to move (next you'd likely drop down due to how the castles are designed) compared to just dropping down and using the ninja roll to negate fall damage.","34","comment"
"silverredbean","2025-03-22","There's this Japanese guy named Shohei Kondo who is milking this ""controversy"" like crazy just because he's of Japanese descent.

Thing is, he's grifting off of the English-speaking gamerbros, incels, and just about any weirdo out there who wants to hate the game.

If he was really angry and serious about this whole thing, he should have been making his videos in Japanese. As in really convince and piss off his fellow countrymen to become anti-Assassin's Creed Shadows.

But he only makes content in English... 🤨

I suspect he forgot all his Japanese (man can't even write in Japanese) and probably had an inkling that the average Japanese normie doesn't give a shit about it (let's be real, they're not perpetually online like the rest of the world and are in a bubble), so he decided to make the anger-tainment content in English to grift off of the weirdos.","34","comment"
"PapaLunegoXI","2025-09-28","I uninstalled it yesterday without ever completing the DLC. I really dig Naoe - she's the most capable assassin of the Assassins in terms of ability. But I just didn't care anymore, and I think that's the first time that's happened to me of all the games in the whole franchise. There were things I liked: choking out guards, going fully prone, etc. It's the things I disliked that were too much to bear: trying to climb a small hill with a sizeable incline or raiding a castle (which I liked doing) that mostly rewards you with stuff like a new hat for your samurai pal.

I'm playing on PS5 Pro's performance mode which gets you RTGI at 60hz and it really shows off the hardware. You can get RT reflections at 40hz but I don't care about that as much as RTGI.

If you are on a base PS5 or Series X and have a 120hz display, absolutely do 40hz. RTGI makes the game look insanely good and it is (personally) worth the performance cost. I think 30hz is more of an open question, it may make combat annoying.","33","comment"

"Impulse_13","2025-05-22","[I Received My Shadows Collector’s Edition Guide Unwrapped with a “Cheap” Dust Jacket When Ordering from Amazon] The reason I’m making this post is because in the past all of the Collector’s Edition guides I bought all came plastic wrapped along with a loose insert under the wrap listing the features of the guide. As for the guides that came with dust jackets, like with Black Flag, actual artwork was on those dust jackets. It looked clean and premium with no wording on it.

The Shadows guide I got from Amazon came without being wrapped in plastic and without a loose insert, just a dust jacket with the same cover as the paperback version. The back of the dust jacket has the feature list printed directly on it, instead of a loose insert like the other guides usually have. The top of the dust jacket has a banner with “www.piggyback.com” on it, which makes it feel more like retail packaging than a proper collector’s edition. The whole thing just feels cheap and I’m thinking Amazon sent me a used or opened copy and tried to pass it off as a new copy with the cheap looking dust jacket.

I saw a YouTube review where the Shadows guide didn’t have the dust jacket and had an actual separate loose insert inside. So now I’m thinking the version I got isn’t the same as what others are getting and i got a opened copy. 

Has anyone else gotten one like this from Amazon or other retailers or is this just me? Was yours packaged differently?

The discourse was insufferable, but a bunch of people hating it for unrelated reasons doesn't suddenly make it good.  Personally I found it a complete bore from both a story and gameplay perspective. The world is incredible but that matters little if there's nothing interesting going on. 

Like you go to Kyoto, this massive city with hundreds of NPCs, incredible detail...and there's nothing to do. No interactivity, no fun side activities, no dynamic events, not even any NPCs standing around to offer you side quests. You follow the main story until you're given a targeted quest, that's it.

 They nailed their open world in Odyssey, with so many dynamic interacting systems and things to discover. How did they regress so much in a couple of years? There's a reason that game was nominated for GOTY alongside heavy hitters like God of War and RDR2, meanwhile Shadows is completely snubbed.","31","comment"
"-elemental","2025-03-20","Im about 4h in, on the Xbox Series X. Playing on hard for both stealth and combat. This is also my first AC game, so I have no basis of comparison with past titles. 

This game is stunningly beautiful, the prettiest game I have ever played. Balanced mode is the way to go, it’s not even close IMO.

It seems very mindful of Japanese culture, with explanations of how to be respectful to some aspects during gameplay. Very cool.

Stealth is NOT easy in general, and the enemies do behave differently (low level ones are easier to trick for example). I found the AI ranging from decent to very good so far.

Combat with Naoe is HARD if you don’t pick your battles wisely. Her agility and parkour skills are amazing though, you do feel like a shinobi.

The prologue is very good and you play much more with Naoe than Yasuke, so I don’t have a feel for how he really plays yet.

Overall I’m very impressed with the game, looking forward to playing it more when I come home from work.

Edit: when I meant that stealth was hard, I forgot to say that I’m deliberately not using Eagle Vision and I’m trying not to rely on tagging enemies. If you use those, it will obviously be easier.","31","comment"

Hunting legendary beasts, finding and slaying mythological creatures, helping old people with their sex problems. The world felt ALIVE and interesting. It was exciting exploring every nook and cranny. Shadows feels mundane, and empty in this regard. I also feel like Shadows lacks memorable boss fights, though I'm only 20 hours in, so that might get proven wrong. So far the gameplay loop is just: go to castle, slay/find x, loot legendary equipment, continue.
Idk, it feels repetitive and bland. Even Valhalla was more interesting with it's mysteries in this regard, and that was already a massive step down from Odyssey IMO.

It has its flaws but it's pros outweigh it's cons for most people.","29","comment"
"jezr3n","2025-06-25","The entire flow of the game gets clobbered the second you go to Azuchi in act 2 and get literally dozens of targets to hunt dumped on you over the course of like 30 minutes. I didn’t find the pacing to be a problem at all up until that point, but afterwards it just feels so messy. And the vast majority of those targets are just buff enemies with nothing special going on, so it really does get repetitive.

It’s unfortunate because in the first act, the whole “investigation board” thing was kind of cool. It did feel like you were discovering things at a decent pace, and things felt pretty intertwined with the story. But that just screeches to a halt in act 2, and the investigation board stops being a novel way to progress through the game and morphs into exactly the kind of checklist I thought the game wasn’t going for. If anything, the questing experience in this game is a marked step down from Odyssey’s regional quest lines that I still find pretty memorable.

That said, I agree that Shadows is pretty good outside of that major flaw. The gameplay in all aspects feels more satisfying than any other game in the series, the visuals are great, and I think it has the best itemization and progression systems of the new era of AC. It’s just supremely let down by the overabundance of pointless targets and lack of context and payoff for most things there are to do. I still go back to it regularly to build up the hideout and infiltrate castles before that smorgasbord of targets drives me away screaming for a week.","29","comment"
"MoDiMiDoFrSaSo","2025-04-02","There are little things that got improved, I agree. I like that you automatically mount your horse when summoned and the auto follow feature is great, but there's lots of mechanics of the game that got worse for me. 

First of all: no quicksave is really weird. Also I really hate the gear system. I didn't care for it in Odyssey either. It stresses me out to constantly upgrade my gear. I was so happy they changed it in Valhalla. 
Accessibility got worse in Shadows as well. Those small subtitles make it hard for me to read them so I don't use ""immersion mode"" anymore (I've watched movies only in the original version with subtitles for more than 30 years). 
No option to switch off level scaling. I suck at stealth in Shadows and get constantly butchered as Naoe.
Last but not least: no portable light source. How am I expected to explore an almost dark as night tomb without a lantern or torch? 

There is a lot I like about Shadows, but especially the gear system takes out most of the fun for me.","28","comment"

Thankfully that's not what we got and what we got was instead an incredible depiction of Nobunaga that fits within the Assassin's Creed lore while still honoring his historical depictions... 

Yasuke and Nobunaga's final interaction at the Honnoji Temple (where the latter died historically) was sincerely heartfelt. Yasuke being grateful for the life that Nobunaga gave him thus forever cherishing their friendship and Nobunaga coming to accept that time was fleeting for him - genuinely beautiful.","28","comment"
"tommycahil1995","2025-10-23","As someone who played Outlaws on PS5 and then again on Switch 2. The port really was insane. It looks great on a TV but just can't believe how good it looks handheld. They cut back on a few subtle things like some of the sand and snow effects but overall was an incredible port. 

Have big hopes for this - obviously different studios and games but I feel like AC Shadows looks great anyway but I think the colour is the most important thing so I feel like they remove some less important stuff like Outlaws did. I had to stop playing Shadows to finish my replay of DS1 before DS2 so hyped to get back to it handheld 

Also anyone who is going to check this out for the first time - put the stealth difficulty on the realistic setting. Way better having enemies able to spot you on rooftops from the ground - makes it a far better stealth game 

(also Ubisoft and CDPR cloud saves across consoles should be the norm now. Great for Cyberpunk, Outlaws and Witcher. Really annoyed I can't do it with Kingdom Come II since I spent 40 hours on the first zone and now don't have the console I did it on so just have to do it all again)","28","comment"
"Roy_Atticus_Lee","2025-03-25","iirc, Dragon Age The Veilgaurd was initially assumed to have been a modest success for EA and Bioware in spite of how divisive of a title it was. It wasn't until EA revealed the game met only 50% of their player expectations that its status as a flop was cemented. 3 million copies for a AAA RPG from EA was super conservative and even that target failed to be met.

AC: Shadows will definitely sell copies in the millions, but whether it'll meet the expectations of Ubisoft, who are already expecting it to be short of AC Valhalla's success, remains to be seen. Whether it'll ""save"" Ubisoft is another question entirely.","27","comment"
"Pricerocks","2025-05-21","[Playing every main game part 10: Origins] 
*“I am a Medjay. I am a feather in the eagle’s wing… a living dagger, plunged from the sky into the heart of chaos. I am a truth unknown… a scabbard unfilled… a son of the Nile… and a defender of the people. You cannot kill me, for I walk among the dead. Come forth by day, and I will guide you home.*

*My son should have learned this prayer.”*

Assassin’s Creed Origins marks 10 years since the release of the original Assassin’s Creed, and takes on the simultaneous tasks of delivering the series’ earliest setting and its most modernized gameplay. Origins is considered a turning point in the series to what is considered the “RPG era” with both gameplay and story pivoting in new directions. I wasn’t really sure what to expect other than change, but somehow, Origins manages to pull it all off. The story is (mostly) great, the gameplay feels refreshed, and overall the game feels bold and more experimental, a stark contrast from its predecessor Syndicate. Although Origins leaves some room for improvement, I found it to overall be a fantastic experience.

Some extra notes before I get into it: I played Origins gold edition on PC with gamepad. I completed all locations, all sync points, all papyri, and all quests in the base map. I didn’t finish the races or arenas but Syndicate did not count its equivalents towards 100% sync so I’m claiming that. According to Steam, my playtime was 65.5 hours, true time probably closer to 60 as I left the game open a few times.

This review covers only the base game, DLC will be a separate post.

#Gameplay
As you probably already know, Origins’ gameplay changes are among the most drastic of the entire series with a shift towards RPG mechanics. I haven’t played many RPGs so I’m not really familiar with genre norms / expectations. The only two other remotely similar series I’ve played are the Arkham games and Star Wars Jedi games. So, I can’t really judge Origins as an RPG, I’ll just be judging it as a game in general. 

##**Core mechanics**
###Stealth
One recurring opinion I’ve picked up on from the community is that the RPG games neglect the stealth aspect of Assassin’s Creed. I agree that it is less fleshed out in Origins than prior games, but I honestly expected it to be way worse than it actually is. In most situations, Bayek is perfectly capable of being an unseen force wiping out mooks, and it’s still pretty dang fun.

The most noticeable stealth change is the reworking of Eagle Vision. Now you literally see through an eagle’s eyes! It took time to adjust to the change, but overall I found it a pretty good system and was able to use it to efficiently mark enemies/loot and scope out areas. I liked using Senu and she’s certainly a big help, but I think I still prefer the style of AC4/ACR/ACS. Then again, I probably would’ve had way more braziers lit that way.

Another big change that I didn’t actually realize for a bit is the absence of social stealth. It’s hard to imagine how it would work in this setting and story(virtually everyone recognizes Bayek as a Medjay and he stands out as an Egytian in Greek/Roman cities) but it’s been a core feature of the game for so long that it sucks to see it go. Part of the cool factor of the early AC games is being the “blade in a crowd”, approaching your enemies visible yet unnoticed. Bayek is what I would call a “blade in the shadows”, the goal is to never be in the open at all.

As far as assassinations, Bayek has a pretty standard ability set that AC veterans will instinctively know how to use, although he is noticeably lacking a double assassination due to Altair canonically being the first guy to realize he has two arms. The replacement, chain assassination, isn’t that great. It allows you to kill an enemy at range, but it A) allows that enemy to see you and alert their friends B) has inconsistent targeting windows and nearly no indication when the ability is activated and C) uses an actual projectile that will hit anything in the way of the target. 

The addition of bows makes ranged stealth easier than ever. I think if AC3 had this bow system it would have been a lot better. That said, Predator bows are overpowered, even more so than Syndicate's throwing knives. You can control the projectile and a later upgrade adds flesh decay to killed targets, harming *anything* that wanders by a corpse (I have to live with the death of innocent cats on my conscience due to this).

Overall I’d say stealth is good but not quite the best (especially in terms of balancing). It’s very viable, but it’s clear Origins wants players to do a lot of fighting.

###Parkour
There’s not much to say about the parkour in Origins. You can do all the standard climbing and even contextual side/back ejects, but the map isn’t designed for the player to do much else. One improvement is that Bayek is pretty good at climbing terrain, and you can pretty much get up anything in the wilderness. Ezio could never.

"flayer99","2025-03-19","[PSA: It seems The latest Nvidia drivers aren't ""Game Ready"" for AC Shadows. RTX 50 Users Beware!] This is PSA for those who have pre-ordered Assassin's Creed: Shadows and have installed the Game Ready 572.83 WHQL drivers. The mods at r/nvidia removed my post so posting it here.

Unfortunately, these drivers are causing issues with the game. **As a reviewer,** I've been testing it for the past week using the 572.75 drivers (based on 572.70) without encountering any problems. However, after installing the latest game-ready drivers,

**I noticed that my GPU was downclocking to 700-780 MHz on my RTX 5080 + Ryzen 7 9700X system**. I used Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) three times and reinstalled the latest drivers each time, but the issue persisted until I reverted to the previous version.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the NVIDIA RTX 50 series had issues when the core voltage slider was unlocked, which could lead to downclocking.

\^This problem was fixed in the 575.75 hotfix update. I can confirm that my situation is not related to that, as I completely wiped out MSI Afterburner and thoroughly cleaned and reinstalled the drivers and rolled back to the stable drivers.

If you're planning to update your drivers, please be cautious. You might encounter similar issues in AC Shadows, especially if you own an RTX 50 series GPU.

"Bolt_995","2025-03-19","Yeah it’s been known for a while now. I won’t say their very existence is at stake based on the financial success or failure of Shadows, but how they move forward in their present form is definitely up in the air.

Pre-orders were kinda strong after reopening them (topped the pre-order charts on the PS Store in my region in a very consistent manner, beating the likes of FH5 and DOOM), but actual sales can paint a very different picture post-launch. 

They attempted to polish the shit out of this game and went all-out with the marketing, pretty much banking everything on this game.

If it doesn’t meet expectations like Outlaws didn’t (but not on that same level), Ubisoft will be in a critical position.

Critical reviews put this on the same level as the last three major games, how that correlates to sales is to be seen.","25","comment"
"E_L_2","2025-06-24","Looks good! I was particularly interested in the Nightmare difficulty (love Shadows' technical combat but we really needed it lol) and I'm curious to see how it will play. I think the biggest change to the current system is the fact that Perfect Dodges and Parries no longer make enemies vulnerable, which was a crucial loop in the combat system thus far. Now, it puts the emphasis on abilities, but even if you don't like to use abilities (I personally don't enjoy most abilities), there are plenty of perks and skills that allow you to put enemies in a vulnerable state and I like that the focus is being given to those. The other biggest thing I'm watching out for is more aggressive enemies - hopefully they really are way more aggressive.

With the ability to further turn off the ""glints"" and other VFX prompts, and I think we'll be in for a real challenge.","25","comment"
"timasahh","2025-11-28","Not super surprised by this though I would have liked to see another. Valhalla though for all its sales success is routinely criticized these days for its bloat and Shadows already has a lot of meat on its bones. Post launch support is great but if three expansions later the only discourse on the game becomes how long it takes to finish the content, I could see them shifting strategy.

Surprised the article doesn’t mention their shift in season pass and preorder bonuses, etc. was a result of the backlash for Star Wars Outlaws. People were losing their shit over the 3 days early access for the deluxe edition pre-order saying it was predatory while ignoring the fact it included the season pass with two expansions.

After all that noise is when they delayed Shadows and changed their pre-order and expansion structure. Not doing it that way also gives them more flexibility since they’re not promising content up front and can better pivot their approach based on post launch feedback. After the lackluster Outlaws release I bet they would have loved to better align resources instead of having to focus on finishing the committed expansions.","24","comment"

Everything until Yasuke and Naoe create the brother hood is actually great...killing the targets after that is boring...all of the enemies are not memorable aside from Mitsuhide and The Mourner.

Act 3 was so incoherent, it just rubbed me the wrong way...like why would you wait till the last 5 - 7 hours of the game to introduce these main villains while having literally 0 build up to them...and then end the game off on the weirdest cutscene.

The lack of mocapped cutscenes is bothering me so much... Shadows Act 1 has more mocapped scenes than all of Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage combined together...and yet, the presentation during the story is still so bad during the rest of the game (and alot of crucial moments throughout the game). 

Origins was able to deliver with all of this (except for Parkour) perfectly...why cant any of the games 8 years later do it?","24","comment"
"General_Berty_Monty","2025-03-28","[my asssassins creed shadows review from a long time assassins creed fan whose played every mainline game.] Hello. I've never posted in this subreddit before, nor have I ever really done game reviews. But after playing through assassins creed shadows totally 60 hours, I had an urge to give my thoughts. As a disclaimer, I have been a long time Assassin's creed fan, with my favourite games and protagonist being the almost too cliche answer of AC 2-revelations with Ezio auditore. But its true that this was peak for the franchise. the world of  renaissance Italy and the story of Ezio being an amazingly well done venture for ubisoft back in the day, one I often like to think about and revisit.   
Another disclaimer is my sheer dislike and almost hatred of the most recent installments. I didn't like odyssey. The story was too reckless with very little care being given. I straight up laughed out loud hard at the ending with the tuxedo (if you know, you know). The only thing that pushed me through was my love for the ancient world of greece. It was refreshing to be able to roam around ancient Greece and explore the ancient city states and the waring nations of the Peloponnesian war. AC valhalla however, was a complete borefest. It felt like a chore to even boot up that game. The story was dull, the setting was gloomy and uninteresting (I say this as an englishman) and I have to confess, I never finished it. I saw the modern day ending on youtube. I began to hate what assassins creed became, losing the true identity it used to have and the story I was deeply invested in. And so when AC shadows came about, I kept my expectations low.... Very low

Now onto the review

Honestly, I was completely surprised by my experience with Shadows. Whilst my expectations were certainly low, it managed to exceed them, not just by a small percentage, but by a great margin. I actually had the most fun playing this game since the release of Assassins Creed Origins in 2017. I found myself impatient to come back home and boot the game on my PlayStation 5 to see where the story continued, to see what parts of feudal japan I had yet to visit in the game. I was left completely swept off my feet in terms of how much more invested I would be to this game, despite my many months of uncertainty and low expectations

the characters - (I played with english language version)   
Honestly, I was surprised by my investment in the characters. I liked the setting of an igan shanobi and a foreign samurai teaming up to fight their foe and go on their own journey of self discovery and growth. At first, I was very unsure about the characters. A black samurai loosely based off a real historical figure we know little about, and a fictional young Japanese woman, who was clearly the main protagonist in my opinion (but in typical ubi style, they cant commit to a female protagonist). Initially opposed to the characters, and somewhat swept under the controversy debates of D.E.I (which I believe went too far and became too ridiculous), I came to accept and be open to the characters Ubisoft chose to explore in this story. And it certainly paid off. I really liked Naoe's personality and motive throughout the story, and I thought her voice actress did an excellent job in making me invested in her character. Similarly, I grew to like Yasuke aswell. This didn't start immediately, as I still believed it should have been a one character story that focused solely on the shinobi, but after a particular sequence of character driven quests, I became invested in Yasuke's story aswell, and decided to play as him more at certain points of my playthrough (Naoe was still my choice of character for up to 70% of the game when given the choice) In the end, Yasuke too has an interesting story arch and I thought his voice actor was also a credit to my investment in the character. These are the best characters in assassins creed since Bayek of Siwa in Assassins creed origins, and may well be a part of my top 10 AC characters from here on. (if it helps, I rank them both higher than connor). 

The story - (I played cannon mode, which I now regret)

Overall, it was an interesting story. I liked the important plot points throughout the game and made sure I didn't miss any of the cutscenes or important dialogue that pushed the story forward. I liked the majority of the main quests and my assassination targets, though at times the two-character approach did mess with my immersion in the story, particularly when they both characters appeared together and then suddenly you're both separated. Similarly, there are so many different story branches to follow like the people of (insert region here) or the character missions or the target missions often causing a mismanaged flow of the game (I understand this is due to my path of playing the missions and the sidequests, but the sheer quantity of missions and sidequests made it hard to keep a natural flow). It is not the best story in the franchise,","24","post"
"Scorpion667","2025-04-18","Doesn't this make sense for Japanese culture though? They're more reserved, going about their business also in a very dangerous time where drawing unnecessary attention to yourself might not be a great idea. Also I feel like with houses like in shadows, having paper thin doors and such people would naturally end up being more quiet because their business is nobody else's especially in Japan where personal shame and reputation are pretty serious to them. They keep to themselves. I actually think this is a nice, more realistic detail that would easily be overlooked and misunderstood as something unintentional.","24","comment"
"whenyoudieisaybye","2025-05-13","Please let me copy/paste my post with review, warning: it’s an angry one

Okay, please, hear me out.

I know many people really really like this game. Despite the review bombing on Metacritic (at which game has ~5/10 from users in average) it has more than 80% positive reviews on Steam and pretty good scores on other markets. Also it seems there are not many people who disliked it on reddit. At least I haven’t seen many posts about how garbage this game is or something like that.

I don’t know why though. Maybe, people just appreciate that after one Ubisoft’s failed release after another they finally have a working product day 1. Perhaps, Ubi’s marketing worked very well this time. Or players just really love the Japanese aesthetic, to the point they willingly close their eyes on many possible flaws. Probably.

This acclaim is double-weird for me because of all the hate the previous AC instances got at their time. People (me included) were complaining about bloat, terrible story and dialogue, overall design leaning to online service business model when they try to keep players in their game as long as possible, hoping they will spend additional money in their pathetic store eventually. And these complains were 100% fair.

But here’s the deal: this time Ubisoft, in my humble opinion, not only didn’t shake the formula, they made things much much worse and I am really curious how people don’t see that.

Let’s start with a story. In short, it’s a garbage. It starts pretty good though, despite a bit slow, but initially it has at least some direction and script. Overall act 1 is not too bad. But then Ubisoft does the thing they like the most: they give you 12 targets and call it a day. Needless to say how scattered the story feels from that moment, how inconsistent and dull the cutscenes are with cringy dialogues and terrible voice acting (english). I forgot almost every target from these 12 almost immediately after I killled them, their story without any hate from my side were one of the most boring, stupid arcs I’ve ever experienced in my life. I am not that kind of person who tends to skip some lines but here I was on the edge of it, most of the time they completely lost me, I can barely even say wtf are these characters talking about.

Then, the side content. It’s abysmal. Pray on 3 shrines? Pick up 4 papers? Some stupid yoga with dumbest QTE in industry? EVERY castle is “kill 3 strong dudes and open the chest”? Fuck it. No, actually, fuck YOU, player, because you have to do this shit in order to progress your character, you need those knowledge points, so let’s waste your time watching the same praying 10 sec animations in 489th time. I mean, how the fuck even someone can enjoy that kind of activities? At least, in previous games you had some ship, some raids. You had side quests. Yes, they weren’t perfect at all, mostly stupid even, but it was something.

Traversing this open world is a pain in the ass too. The parkour is somehow worse this time, and speaking of which, you can really parkour only with Naoe. So while traveling it’s almost mandatory to swap on her because Yasuke is so hulking, playing him in open world can really make you alt+f4 this game and never boot it again. And the swapping in this game means you need to go to the inventory tab and then wait a bit. Which means loading, loading and loading. Yeah, this game is full of loading and black screens by the way, I stopped speaking to merchants for example after 5 hours in game because of how long and stupid the loading before you actually get the access to the store. Maybe they are synchronising all the data with their damn online store 24/7 and that is why it’s so slow, but I swear, after 5-10 hours I was already so tired of this shit I was always thinking twice about open ANY menu in game.

And yeah, to adding the previous topic, like 70% of the game’s map are fucking woods, cliffs and mountains, making the experience of exploring in this world even worse.

Speaking of exploration. Oh boy. Can someone explain me why should I bother to open ANY chest in this game except Legendaries? Is there any point to loot non-legendary gear after 5 hours in game or so? Plants for the hub in high security areas is a good enough reward for you? What the fuck were they smoking while making this system like that? I ended up just ignoring all the chests pretty quickly and I am happy I did because I lost nothing, instead I saved much time which probably made Ubi sad cause of their player retention shit strategy.

And don’t even let me start about how incomplete this game is. It has no climax, it has no ending, after some random mission there is a cliffhanger and they just say “fuck you, watch the titles and wait for dlc”. No, thank you.

The combat is clunky as fuck too. The hitboxes are complete joke. Yasuke’s jump and smash, for example, sometimes hit half the area, sometimes you perform it among the 10 mobs and only 1 gets hit. The balance is non-existent too.","23","comment"

"Select_Ad3588","2025-04-14","Also where did you hear this? The article only states the possibility of it being Naoe + Yasuke. Doesn't mention any other detail though. But honestly thinking logistically, it wouldn't make sense for players to be forced to use a tank character and a stealth character simultaneously. You can make it work sure but seems way more fun to either have two tanks or two stealth characters so you can actually plan missions in a cohesive way.","20","comment"
"InsaneMarshmallow","2025-11-28","That’s too bad. I thought Claws of Awaji, while not perfect, showed interesting gameplay improvements with the characters significantly impacting the open world with traps, ambushes, and patrols. And an interesting take on a boss fight that actually utilized stealth and strategic movement. I was hoping they’d continue to build upon that with major expansions, as Shadows’ setting, art design, stealth and combat gameplay are some of the best the series has had to offer.","19","comment"
"HanS0lPurr","2025-03-23","Ok so I'm still early on, just finished Naoe's 4th Kuji-kiri. I've heard from reviewers that it's a super slow start, which can be expect more times than naught with these games. But I can't help but feel like the writing structure has already needlessly complicating the pacing. 

We start as Yasuke for a beat, then go to Naoe's perspective - all while having mechanics tutorialized. Then, after we hit the title card. I had a feeling that it was uncharacteristically early in comparison to the other entries with a lengthy prologue, so I'm thinking 'wow, all right we're just getting right into it'

Then we get into the open world properly and I'm doing this Kuji-kiri... just to get more lengthy side quests to add in repeated tutorialization and more exposition, re-emphasizing the whole ""Father I'm ready, I'm not weak"" vs ""Stay safe, you're not ready"" trope - after we just went through that in the events of the second invasion?

Idk, I feel like this would have been way smoother just telling Naoe's story starting from the first invasion and progressing through those quest vignettes to go right into the second invasion?

Is anyone else just totally thrown off by this structure/pacing choice? 

Please tell me the Kuji-kiri in the other regions don't do this.","18","comment"

people will excuse it saying it's for the good of gaming but all this does is tire people and not even bother listening to feedback from people who actually play the game.

"dunkindonato","2025-03-20",">Something I've been curious about is that with all the comics and books, mobile games, and such, there's been some info about Japan already so I wonder how much will get retconned now that a game is here.

A retcon to previously established lore isn't necessary or wide-reaching, because Kakushiba Ikki as a League is its own thing, but they still inherited the Creed and follows its tenets. 

Naoe's parents (Nagato and Tsuyu) are part of an earlier Kakushiba Ikki. Tsuyu was trained by an excommunicated Assassin (I forgot his name. Alvaro something?) who still believes in the cause (I think he killed an innocent by mistake), and arrived in Japan, and built a Brotherhood there. 

So, they're not ""official"" Assassins in the sense that they're connected to the wider Brotherhood network. But they were created by an Assassin, bringing Assassin equipment, insignia, and its tenets.","18","comment"
"mroowol","2025-03-26","""Freeze Spikes"" introduced with Hotfix 1.0.1

Hotfix 1.0.1  just broke the game (PC, Ubisoft Connect, Windows 10 and drivers are up to date). The PROBLEM  now is, that everytime I loot something or use action button the game gets freeze spikes. No matter if ammo, chests, or containers, now there are freeze spikes. Same whenever opening doors.

Before the update 1.0.1 it was fine, but now it's broken.

I verified files - no solution, problem still persists

I reinstalled game - no solution, problem still persists

Please fix this asap.

Does anyone gets similar problems?

I still preferred Naoe, but the writing wasn’t good enough. Seriously this year only: after playing Mafia The Old Story, a 15 hours linear game, E33 of course, or even KCD2, I tend to realise that one major issue in Ubisoft recent games is the writing part. Don’t want to shame anyone there or pressure someone’s job, but they should look for someone able to deliver. This quality of level design should match a top level story + top level audio.","17","comment"
"brotherofgurnip","2025-04-24","Regarding the final act, spoilers ahead:

>!I feel Ubisoft had to make a decision if this was going to be the next 'Ezio' style franchise with a trilogy, because the three Imperial Regalia boxes would naturally allow for a trilogy (that is to say, only if they were supposed to be pieces of Eden - which was never confirmed, however I think the initial plan was to tie this into the Inu/precursor civilisation storyline, but was ultimately changed to cut down on story bulk and dev time). But somewhere down the line, and perhaps in part after the various controversies during its development, they (or the investors) made the decision to severely cut the story down to size - potentially even resorting to resolving the (imo) cliff-hanger ending with DLC instead of a brand new game. I personally doubt it would be possible to generate and carry over enough momentum from this game due to the massive amount of time it takes to make AAA games these days, and quite frankly, despite being a good game, it just didn't offer 'enough' for many fans to feel invested in the future of the characters like they did for Ezio. With regards to Assassin's Creed as an established story about Assassins versus Templars, fighting over the control of ancient pieces of advanced technology that could control the world - extremely little of this is covered in Shadows, in fact its kind of bewildering that none of this is explored until a couple hours before main story ends. I feel this was an area the devs probably wanted to spend more time on but were faced with the decision to cut it out or turn it into DLC/a follow-up game, otherwise I don't know how to explain the almost complete omission of basic AC elements besides the Assassins versus Templars aspect.!<","17","comment"

It's not that they are unrealistic (they are, but it's fine in a videogame), it's that the inherent nature of free running and tricking doesn't seem to match the tone of the game - it's showing off, plain and simple. I can absolutely see Ezio in his younger years and Edward doing flips as young and brazen assassins, but Ubisoft is portraying Naoe as some sullen and serious woman driven for revenge, and then she does a side flip landing for funsies.","17","comment"
"ZaDu25","2025-03-15","Shadows addresses some of my biggest problems with Ghost of Tsushima, like the lack of weapon variety, the shallowness of the stealth mechanics, and the lack of actual big densely packed cities. I hated how Ghost of Tsushima was just a lot of open space with some villages that had the same 3 buildings copy and pasted. I think that contributed heavily to it feeling so repetitive.

1. Actual Assassin and Templar inclusion. The hidden blade has importance to the story, and the templars seem to have a genuine role to play. While the Hidden Ones and Order of Ancients was a fun enough precursor setup to the organizations we have now, it's great to see the original groups again.
2. Racism towards Yasuke. Or at least a hostile, distant attitude towards him from Nobunaga. Around halfway through the trailer.

"Halucinogenije","2025-05-06","I really enjoyed my time with Shadows, after not being able to finish (or enjoy at all) Valhalla, this one did it for me. But I did feel a bit burnt out in the end, the bloat is still there. Also, the fact that I tried to squeeze the whole game in one month's worth of Ubi+, but I'll probably get it on some deep discount when all the story DLCs come out.

Mirage was also fun, and it became a bit tedious in the end but Valhalla is probably the worst offender in the whole of gaming when it comes to not respecting the player's time.","16","comment"
"Rymann88","2025-03-31","I'm getting up to 50 hours now, and this game is definitely up there in my top 5, if not in my top 3.

Granted, I'm the player that refuses fast travel, even if the objective is 1000km away. I'm still hoofing it with a smile because the landscape and the graphics make it a soothing experience for me.

Yes, there are a number of shortcomings. Certain accessibility features from Valhalla are gone, which should honestly become another staple of the series with the amount of tweaks we could make for our individual experiences.

The main quest started off very strong, but it ends up just kinda... Tapering off. It is very much a front-loaded experience in that regard, as the narrative loses momentum as the story goes on when it should be the opposite. I'm not in act 3 yet since I'm mostly doing the side targets, knowledge points, etc. But I've seen enough comments on the story that the stakes don't escalate, which past games did. Each new major target had more sway throughout the region, which meant targeting them was more difficult, but the reward had a larger impact. I get the sense that is not the case in this game. Granted, this is also a consequence of having such a massive game world. Not to mention, they've been leaning harder into player agency. This isn't a bad thing, but it does get to a point where it detracts from the overall concept of raising the stakes.' I'm not even going to talk about the lack of moral ambiguity of the targets. They comic book villains, and therefore, less interesting. Delving into the moral grayness of their machinations used to be interesting. Not so for me, at least so far.

But the gameplay makes up for it, for me, at least. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, and that's totally fine. A few additional tweaks and smaller features here and there can improve on this. It's up to the post-launch team if the effort is worth doing now or taking notes and pushing it higher up the priority list for the next game.

All in all, I think the next cluster of games should dial back on the extreme elements of their approach to certain aspects. The maps don't need to be this big. It increases the risk of burnout, as players will just get frustrated with having to cross large portions of the map because they haven't been to that region yet and don't have fast travel points. A tighter narrative doesn't have to mean reducing player agency and will certainly help with creating a narrative that shows the escalating intensity of events and possibly the effect such stress can have on the characters. AC games thrived when the story was as much about the character's personal experience and growth as it was about the events.

I love the AC franchise, and I very much want it to keep going. Shadows is a step in the right direction in many areas. But it still struggles with some of the other issues the franchise has. If Ubisoft continues on this trend of continuing to in stages without compromising in other areas, we might finally get a damn good AC game that we've been looking forward to since AC2 and Black Flag.","16","comment"

My only real issue so far is that I have the physical copies of each AC so I can’t access the other games from the animus hub.

The mysteries, raids, even flighting I found much more enjoyable than what Shadows is doing. Shadows side content boils down to find these pages, pray at these shrines, draw this bird, do this rhythm mini game. It’s so incredibly boring.

I don’t understand why they didn’t have things like a ninja star throwing game, riddle solving, pouring tea and cooling it properly (kind of like the ramen mini game from Yakuza) idk anything other than this would have been better.

"Pricerocks","2025-06-19","[Playing every main game part 10.5: Origins DLC] 
Assassin’s Creed Origins is a long game. Naturally, it’s followed by the longest DLC expansions in the series thus far. While not quite as exciting or experimental as other expansions, Origins’ DLC carries on the great gameplay and (in one expansion) quality storytelling the base game thrived on. 

Before publishing this review, I finished all viewpoints, locations, and quests in the game. This brings my final playtime to ~88 hours, with 28 of that spent in the DLC. I played on PC with gamepad.

##**The Hidden Ones**
###**Gameplay**
Hidden Ones doesn’t really change anything from the base game in terms of gameplay mechanics or features. That’s okay, because Origins already has great gameplay. The arenas are noticeably larger and much more crowded with enemies, but in my experience I didn’t find this to make much of a difference in difficulty. Still, it feels way cooler to sneakily dispatch 40 guys in a fort than it does to kill 5 guys in a small camp. I assume the level cap was raised when this and COTP came out, and I was already in the 50s when starting this so I had an easier time than I probably would have when this first came out.

The side content is all the same as the base game, including two new Phylakes who are even less threatening than the base game ones. There’s a fair amount of side content to stretch out the DLC a few more hours, but if you’re only doing story quests you could probably finish Hidden Ones in two hours or less.

Story
The story of Hidden Ones is really where the DLC shines. While Origins may have fumbled the formation of the Brotherhood, the story has moved past that and now we get to see what Bayek actually does as the first Mentor of the Hidden Ones.

The intro scene is really cool, with a blind musician reintroducing Bayek as a legendary figure in a scene which has tons of what I can only call “aura” or “the sauce”. This also foreshadows a problem Bayek faces in this story— the Hidden Ones are a little too well known. Bayek’s new gear is great as well, bringing him more in line with the traditional Assassin robes. 

Bayek is here to help out Tahira (imagine the continuing confusion of people who didn’t do side quests) with a revolution in Sinai. We meet Gamilat, the most obvious twist villain ever, and establish what our goal in Sinai is: Kill 3 targets to lure out the Roman general Rufio.

Two of the nonlinear three targets aren’t really memorable, we get a generic cutscene showing how they treat everyone like shit and then we kill them. However, I have to give props to the Animus corridors once again because they are absolutely freaky this time around. And all 3 of these targets end with a reminder: “The Order is eternal.”

The third, more memorable target is named Ptahmose. He’s a little more interesting because the harm he is doing to Egypt goes beyond physical abuse— he is actually making them destroy sacred structures and sites, partly in order to locate a pair of fabled swords forged with metal from a meteor. Being the over-achiever that I am, I noticed the giant tree looked funny and did the entire puzzle to get the swords before I even understood the lore implications of what they were. Then, I used them to kill Ptahmose and he actually had a special dialogue where he recognized I had found them before him. 

When all 3 targets are dead, Bayek returns to the Sinai bureau, where the Hidden Ones are promptly ambushed and captured. Bayek is crucified but right before he is executed, a small sword cuts through one of the ropes binding him. It’s Aya! I mean, Amunet! She also has some fresh drip that decidedly *doesn’t* look like traditional Assassin attire. The two escape and rescue Tahira and some other guy, but Tahira dies of her wounds after urging Bayek to continue the creed. Because of the whole thing with her being forced into the story regardless if you had met her, I’ve always found it hard to take Tahira seriously, but this scene was pretty well done and definitely made me mourn her.

Amunet explains that she’s here because the Sinai bureau’s activities have been so loud that she was hearing news about them even in Rome. There’s also discussion of a possible traitor amongst the Hidden Ones, a plot point which I believe is never mentioned again. We go to kill Rufioh but on the way we discover a nearby village is being massacred by the Romans. One of the villagers calls out to Bayek by his name, another sign the Hidden Ones are becoming too well known.

Bayek then assassinates Rufio, and there’s another Animus corridor that is cool as hell but has no real meaningful dialogue, just like the others.

When that’s done, Amunet tells us that Gamilat has been purposely provoking Roman attacks on innocent settlers to turn their deaths into martyrdom, inspiring survivors to join the rebels. After a brief conversation which feels more like Bayek preparing Gamilat for an ass whooping than earnestly trying to convince him he’","15","post"

The world looked beautiful, but was a hassle to navigate. The combat was fine. I liked Naoe and Yasuke as characters but only played as Yasuke when I had to. I couldn’t care less about the story. The objective board was so big I didn’t even know why I was killing targets or what was going on in each quest line.

"[deleted]","2025-05-12"," \- It would be cool if Yasuke had the ability to knock people out like Naoe can. Maybe he puts them in a sleeper hold or just punches them?

\- Dual-wield class for Yasuke? Long katana and the wakizashi currently on his belt. Or alternatively the ability for him to use the wakizashi as a stealth weapon.

\- Some more saddle designs for each character's horses. Yasuke's are a bit too garish at times and some simpler saddles would be nice for him to use when travelling in a lower profile. Naoe's have some good variety.

\- More execution/takedown animation variety. The ones we have are great but can become repetitive.

\- Underwater locations. More pirates.

\- The ability to put bodies back on the horse again. In Valhalla you could create some interesting traps using bodies for explosive ambushes and could carry them around if need be.

\- Allow us to re-read evidence notes. In the inventory screen it merely provides a summary, so if you missed something or need a full reminder, you can't view it again.

\- More detective style, tracking missions. Following clues is fun. These were some of the best missions in the other RPG titles.

"TheMerck","2025-03-24","Yep I haven't personally liked an AC game since Origins, I've played all of the AC games at release but I didn't really like Origins that much and Odyssey made me tap out of the series because it just didn't personally vibe with me anymore.

Does that mean I think they are bad? Obviously not I don't think they are particularly amazing games but their formula works especially for more casual or people who just want to boot up an open world game with. I had the realization of this with Valhalla when I saw how many people praised it I tried it and realized AC still isn't for me I thought it was a slog but lots of people even friends of mine rate it highly.

And that's fine, people in the internet sincerely need to realize this if you don't like a game IT'S FINE you don't have to like every game but spending all your time hating on a game on a game you already know you won't like or even bother to try playing. I feel like a lot of the internet and the current negativity culture has made terminally online people think they need to like everything and if it's something they don't like or not made for them it's automatically the worst thing ever made.

Like I'm not gonna bash people for still liking the AC series, Shadows looks fun I might try it out some time especially after I've heard they improved the stealth but if I don't like it it'll be whatever the game might have some shortcomings but I won't treat it as the worst thing ever made or I encounter a minor bug and think the game is broken.

But a lot of people and not just in gaming but in any media discussion right now can't comprehend the mere and simple fact that: Just because you don't personally like something doesn't automatically mean it's bad, not talking about if you think something is mediocre or great but BAD, especially if a person doesn't even bother to try the game and just base off their opinion off of a YouTube video or Twitter clip they saw

Edit: Also I should reiterate obviously you can think things are bad or dislike things, my main general point now is people treat any media right now as either the greatest thing in the world or absolute dogshit with no inbetween and have a clear bias to it, an 8/10 can be considered as the best/worst game for some people depending on if it's from a studio or franchise they like, a game could have tons of bugs and performance issues but again if it's from something they like it's handwaved away but if it's from the opposite even minor bugs are treated and exaggerated like it's Cyberpunk on release bugs.","14","comment"

"NY12251990","2025-08-26","[Getting back to the AC franchise with Mirage] For context, I've played all AC games in one way or another, but I've only completed AC3 and Origins. Mirage is the third one, thanks to Game Pass lol. I was highly interested with Shadows but because I was out of the loop for a while, I figured I'll play Mirage first.

Here's just my quick personal review of the game:

1. Gameplay - It was truly a return to form for the franchise as advertised. I'm into playing stealth games, so having a simple premise of just sneaking in and killing your targets was a good starting point for me as someone trying to get back into the franchise. While it feels bone dry coming in from the RPG trilogy, it was enough to make you feel like a true master assassin.
2. Story - Ngl, I'm in touch with AC lore through YouTube, haha. And while I wasn't able to piece Basim from Valhalla, his origin story and what he eventually becomes was a good story for me. It wasn't complicated or anything, you needed to kill certain members of the order, getting to the climax, and finding out the truth. Question now lies is what's the bigger picture for Basim. Interesting to see how they keep the ball rolling with his story.
3. Post-game/collectibles - I try to complete all objectives and for the most part, some are fun, some I needed to check on YT. But otherwise, it kept you enough to platinum the game. I still have to play that 40 Thieves mission, and there is some excitement for that free DLC later this year. Good reason not to uninstall it yet.

Overall, it was great. For someone like me who's in and out of the AC franchise, this was a good way to re-enter the fold. While I understand the franchise has to evolve and keep flexing how they can maximise it, an AC game that is pure stealth and simple game mechanics is a nice touch once in a while. Now, I can move on to Shadows.","14","post"

The graphics and world are beautiful and impressive, and the huge towns are stunning, but they feel so completely lifeless.

"Ebo87","2025-03-27","over 6 million of those hours were on Steam, so the numbers definitely check out with the percentages we've been following, just in case there's some here who think this is fake news or whatever (I doubt anyone like that would be here of all places, but you never know, there might be lurkers, lol).

To further break the numbers down, we know PC was 27% and we know Steam is over 6 million hours now, out of a grand total of over 40 million hours. That would be 15% of the hours played, although I bet Steam players in general might have a higher average number of hours than say... other platforms. So hard to say exactly how many copies each platform has.

Currently I imagine 800k players are on PC (playing on Steam, Ubisoft Connect or playing through Ubisoft+), 700k on Xbox and 1.5 million on PS5.

For PC that is absolutely the biggest launch ever for an Assassin's Creed title, since this is a series that in the past leaned much more towards consoles.

But between the day 1 launch on Steam, the Intel sponsored copies (for people buying certain Intel CPUs), and Ubisoft+, you can see how it helped push Shadows to a series best on PC.","14","comment"
"Soft_Engineer5126","2025-03-23","Do you consider Naoe and Yasuke Assassins? Because:

>!Naoe Yasuke and Junjiro said they were all Kakushiba Ikki when they united doing their oath when they first united. After Hattori Hanzō sends Naoe to find answers Naoe and Yasuke read the book together and talk about following the Assassins Creed basically the best they can. Continuously refer to the Assassin also as Kakushiba Ikki and after reading about all the recruiting messages and how her mom was an Assassin talks about how they are continuing their work.!<

>!So I’ve seen online other people seem to interpret it as a different newly created version of the brotherhood since Alvaro Catarribera was kicked out of the Brotherhood for breaking a tenant, but he basically created a new Assassin creed brotherhood sect to combat a growing Templar presence he noticed coming to Japan. He still uses the Assassin Creed symbol to create them. He uses all the same tenets and I think reading Naoe even talked about how they referred to the group as Assassin’s if I remember correctly. Which seems like Alvaro intent was just to create a sect of Assassin’s to fight the Templar and not a new thing which would make it seem like they are an Assassins, but he was also kicked out so if they don’t have a connection to the greater scheme of things would they be a different sect based on the Assassins?!<

>!But also on the other hand Darius was before the hidden ones time but fighting for the cause before they unified under one was honored with an Assassin tomb. Where Assassins can recognize people after they died for fighting for the same ideals of the creed is having the same unifying factor really the biggest part to what makes an Assassin an Assassin and creating this group would you consider them Assassin’s, or since the creator was kicked out of the Assassins would you just consider them a different group based on the Assassins’s? I kind of consider both Yasuke and Naoe Assassin’s unless they actually do officially become assassins later and it’s shown they never were actually Assassin’s. But it’s kind of a confusing situation that I’d like help with getting other perspectives.!<","14","comment"

I waited to play Valhalla till last year and basically had no problems with the stealth and other detection glitches that people were complaining about on release, plus got transmog, a lot of DLC and other quality of life upgrades.

Waited to play Mirage till the end of last year too and got parkour improvements and ng+ (permadeath too though I didn't use it).

Now they're literally giving a free update to Mirage that makes parkour way better, adds new options, dlc and more stuff? I literally should've waited even longer to buy it lol.

So why does this post then mention the **BLACK** Samurai Yasuke 4 times including in the title just outright referring to the game as ""Assassin's Creed Yasuke"" when the character and his race have nothing to do with the story or controversy?  You don't even have to play as this character, you can be a Japanese woman instead.

Shadows, though, is not only a fun game, but a great **Assassin's Creed** game. It is the best AC of the last decade, and possibly even longer than that. I never thought I'd appreciate Ubi Québec that much, but this game earns them my utmost respect. 

They also seem to be focused on QoL and community feedback for this game, so I'm looking forward to the things they'll be adding soon as per community feedback, things like removing the black and white filter if you want to, and keeping headgear during cutscenes.","13","comment"

Especially when that game was revised better, sold better and made vastly more money.

And while the main story is significantly shorter than Valhalla and the explorable space in Shadows is also smaller than in Valhalla, I’d argue that game had not only a better story overall but also the better experience of actually exploring therefore and doing side stuff!

If anything, Shadows did t lear  enough from the criticisms thrown at Odyssey and Valhalla.

Yes, the core gameplay pillars are arguably better in Shadows, especially stealth and combat, but the sense of exploration and doing worthwhile stuff was imo better in those games.

Like, Odyssey and especially Valhalla got tiring because there was too much of it.
Whereas Shadows gets tiring, because there isn’t enough variety and story to maintain it!","13","comment"
"DrJoker94","2025-05-13","[[SPOILERS] Assassin's Creed: Shadows Review - Quo Vadis, Ubisoft?] Hi everyone,

After finally completing the game I have gathered enough thoughts to firmly claim, as someone who's been with the series since the adventures of Altair, someone who had huge hopes for Shadows, someone who wished for the revival of the series: This is not it. This might as well be the worst installment in the franchise's post-Origins era.

**Spoilers of the entire plot ahead, but let me first say some good things, so that I am not considered a grifter or a troll.**

First of all, the choice of two protagonists - while not necessarily my absolute favourite, I appreciate giving the players the choice of approach. For the first time, different characters feel different. Jacob and Evie were the original concept of 'stealth versus brawl' but in the end their gameplay was the same. And later, both Kassandra/Alexios and Eivor were characters definitely more forward-approach oriented. They didn't have that Assassin feel to them. Here, we have that solved for us: Naoe is fast and stealthy, Yasuke is a tank. People are getting exactly what they expect.

Naoe's tools and mechanics - I like it. She feels like a proper shinobi: hides, goes prone, uses tools, have plenty of assassinations methods. I would've implemented a disguise mechanic instead of having her running around in her *shinobi shozoku* which is a night-time mission outfit but transmogs will fix that. The idea of not only synchronization points but also the *kakurega* seving as fast-travel points was also a good idea.

Unfortunately, that's all the positives I have that set *Shadows* apart from every other post-Origins installment. Now, let me tell you about the biggest issue I have with this game:

**THE PLOT**

The plot makes absolutely zero sense. Everything we had to do in the game was completely out of the left field. How could you have hundreds of people, working years on a game (judging by whopping TWO HOURS of endgame credits) and create something that's *not* Assassin's Creed? In *Origins, Odyssey,* and *Valhalla* we've had a clear story about the proto-Assassins, the beginnings, and their connections to the Isu. It made sense. And what happenes in Shadows? Not only, we've got the modern day story >!basically stolen from us (replaced with what I can best describe as two sentient Could servers fighting one another)!<, we've also >!been robbed of any behind-the-scenes Assassins vs. Templars conflict: the Templar Hunt with Yasuke was one of the most interesting part of the game and it virtually comes *at the very end*!<. After finishing Act 1, >!we've been given yet another Grind Simulator. Just check off the names, take part in Japan's internal struggle, and only been given crumbs of actual plot the story's named after!!<

Next - who's idea was it to >!make the ""plot"" revolve around the Imperial Regalia, which we don't even get to see or know what they do (assuming they're PoE but even that we can't know for sure), we didn't learn what danger awaits the Kakushiba-ikki, nothing; Dad just said 'get the box'. !<

We learn about >!the Japanese Templars from *four* targets out of many, and those are actually connected to Yasuke, who is not even an Assassin, rather than Naoe who has a faint connection to them. And about the Assassins themselves, we learn from two lines of dialogue and scraps of papers found in their hideout. We don't know anything about Tsuyu, Naoe is once again repeating the ""last Assassin vs big Templar (using those words generously here) network"".!<

I feel like the plot of *Shadows*, the elements of it that should be crucial for a fan of the franchise, could've been condensed into a prologue or an Act 1 of an actual Assassin's Creed installment. And I'm pretty sure I know why is that - *Shadows* is yet another live service title. I am certain *Claws of Awaji* and the future updates/DLCs will give us more elements of the story, but believe that shouldn't be direction games like that should go. We've ordered a pepperoni pizza and we were given a pizza box with a plain pie and a cup full of sauce.

In conclusion: I don't care about how *Shadows* performs as a Japanese game (AKA those who praise *Ghost of Tsushima*). I don't care about the skin colour of a samurai we play as. My only question is: Why didn't you make an *Assassin's Creed* game, Ubi?","13","post"
"ZeroSWE","2025-04-24","My main  gripes with the game is that there is no joy of exploration because I know i will just find more tedious shrines, temples and boring mini-games such as archery, meditation and kata. 


All the refined systems of Shadows is great, but there isn't much to be found in its world. Neither location or actual varied story driven sidequests. 


I need new kind of quests to return to the game. I also hope they will add new open world content. I don't want to wait for Naoe to clap 15 times throughout a gaming session. ","13","comment"
"Shapes_in_Clouds","2025-03-31","Finally.  So many settings it's really hard to figure out what is what, these videos help a lot.  I have 7800x3D and 4080S with 4k monitor and just cranked up everything to the max.  Game looks downright stunning, near photoreal at times.  The framerate was giving me a headache though, I think it was averaging around 30.

The high optimized settings here help a lot, feels a ton smoother and basically locked at 60.  Using DLSS Quality.  Visuals still look great, but the hit is noticeable.  Shadows and lighting aren't as good and scenes overall look more video-gamey.  The Ultra RTX and shadows looks so good.  I leave specular on rather than just diffuse, and the high quality hair on all characters left on as well.  Still looks amazing, and worth it for framerate, but this is definitely a game where people with the best hardware are rewarded handsomely.","13","comment"

"Evanescoduil","2025-03-24","What confounds me is people saying Tsushima was a better AC game.

I love that game deeply, but it objectively was just an imitation of AC **when it comes to the parts of AC it aped.** It did it admirably, but Jin couldn't climb everything. He could only climb Uncharted style handholds. Jin couldn't flip off rooftops oozing style, he could only hand-hang or zoop himself off with a floating fall. Jin had no concept of darkness. Jin had no concept of ambient enemy hearing (they could still ""hear"" his lure chimes). Enemies barely ever looked for Jin if they saw him go around a corner. Jin also only had a single animation for killing multiple people in stealth simultaneously. The entirety of Tsushima was fun, but gamey. My only gripe with that game when it came out and to this day is that the game's world feels like it's always waiting for you.

Again, I love Ghost of Tsushima so much, but if it had come out after this game, it would be called very pretty, but a lesser imitation of Shadows. People just think ""similar good game that was first"" means it's better no matter what's in front of them.

Shadows is a better stealth game by leagues. What Ghost of Tsushima did very well was Samurai combat and fusing it's aesthetic, and I'd argue myself even that Shadows straight up lifted some of those stylistic choices because they saw how effective they are.

But Shadows is not just a better stealth game than we've gotten in recent years, it's also just a Good Assassin's Creed game. I've liked all of them, but after the release of Valhalla feeling like an excuse to appeal to non-stealth fans, this feels like a love-letter apology to the stealth fans who have been waiting patiently to sink back into the Shadows.","12","comment"
"Tartarus_Champion","2025-04-04","I mean, what I'm about to say isn't exactly on topic, but Nobunaga is pretty much every ninja game's favorite punching bag lol. I'm glad he had a fighting chance here.


How many times did I have to assassinate him or his commanders in games like Tenchu? 😏
I knew almost nothing about Shadows when it came out except that it had the two protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. I knew about some controversy surrounding them; however, I kept myself blissfully ignorant of most of it. I'm glad I did if I'm honest.


I have not cleared the game in over 122 hours, and I'm not bored. The game finds new ways to draw me in. A lot of those reasons are things I did not know about Japan. I also like how the game quizzes you on historical facts with those random encounters with the riddle master. I still can't get those right, so that presses me to learn more about Japan.


Anyway, I digress. Nobunaga in this game seems like a human being, and not some random shogun or daimyo to use as a prop for political agendas. I can relate to his madness and the brilliance of his tactics. I have no idea if the way he is portrayed here is historically accurate, but I do know that he's movie level believable at least -- and that is all I needed to feel for the guy despite Naoe's motivations.","12","comment"

What's the issue you ask? Well, normally in games (ironically, also in every single Assassin's Creed game before Shadows) you invert only the camera controls. But for some reason, Ubisoft decided to invert *every single right stick interaction in the game* instead. This means that the map zoom in/out is backwards and scrolling in, say, messages is upside down (down is up and up is down).","11","comment"

I actually enjoy many of Ubisoft franchises. Assassin Creeds, Watch Dogs, ANNO, Far Cry. They just know how to make beautiful big open world games!

Valhalla was the best selling game in the series but I'm pretty sure that I will be enjoying Shadows much more than Valhalla. 

I finally got bored in the middle of that Ragnarok DLC and uninstalled the game. I played all the previous DLCs and enjoy them all.

One of the thing that I hate about Valhalla was that female Eivor and male Eivor was pretty much the same. I play female Eivor the entire time but it didn't really matters.

I pre-order Shadows Digital Deluxe Edition off Ubisoft Connect the moment pre-order was allowed for like $72 using Ubisoft Units 20% discount.

"earthisflatyoufucks","2025-11-02","[An ACII Review from someone who is replaying all the games] Hello everyone, first time posting here.

Resently I thought about replaying every main game in order to form a more cohesive opinion on the series and its individual entries.

My first game from the series was black flag that i played back in 2014 and not only does this game hold a special place in my heart, it is also generaly regarded as one of the best entries in the series. So it is safe to say that my introduction to the series was a solid one.

  
Note that i have finished every game of the series since then except valhala and shadows (since i dont have them) and revelations (since i got bored of it although i was younger at the time).

  
I have just finished replaying AC2 and the first thing i noticed before even booting the new save file is that i had already played the game 3 times becasue i already had 3 save files from different dates. That wasnt really a good sign for me, becasue even though i remembered i had finished the game in at least one of those save files, i didnt remember almost anything from the story. Let me begin this discussion by stating that i dont have any nostalgia factor for this game since, i ve firstly played it almost a decade after its release and after playing other, more recent and arguably more polished entries. Ill begin this listing of my thoughts by splitting the aspects of the game into good and bad categories. With that being said, lets begin.



**The good**

\-Like many others in this sub, i share the sentiment that this game's intro is one of the best we have seen inside the series, and to me it is its best point in the whole game. Some may dislike it becasue of how slow it is, but i think it has the perfect pacing to set up Ezio as a character and the circumstances that made him walk the path of the assassin in this and the next two entries. It doesnt drag, it doesnt waste itslef on meaningless quests, and it goes to the point when all is set. Quite well executed

\-I was also amazed by how well everyone was voice acted (even though ezio does sound like an american that tries to talk english with an italian accent) and how expressive the faces of the characters were, especially for such an old game. 

\-Also, the parkour was generally responsive and it had a more technical depth that newer installations, but i wouldnt really say it is superior, it just has a different feel that it works for what it is. I will say though that is kinda does get boring and repetitive when you watch ezio reach with one hand and then stop and then repeat. It does feel like a slog sometimes. I wouldnt say though that i had a problem with it overall, just small nitpicks like, why doesnt ezio fall to the platform right below him when pressing right click like he does in brotherhood? Many times it feels like i have to stop my momentum and press shift and then drop manually for a fall that should happen instantly while pressing right click. The game does seem to understand this but it seems only to work with very small falls. Fortunately brotherhood seems to have fixed this.

\-Finally, ill say that, even though the cities dont seem that special to me (we will get to that later) ,maybe due to the limitations of the time, they have found a clever way to make them feel distinct, manely the ""feel they eminate"" meaning the filter its city has. Florence has a yellow fillter making it feel warm and welcoming, like a homecity should feel. Monteriggioni is gloom and dark, enhancing the degradation of the city that seems to somewhat change while building the city up, and it becomes a lot warmer in the begining of brotherhood. Romanga/Flori has a piss-stain grey filter, for... obvious reasons since it is a city build on wetlands and mud. San gimignano was also gloomy, and to be honest quite irrelevant for me so yeah.... And fianally venice had a light blue filter that fitted well for a city that immersed in water. 

  
**The not so good**

Now for the rest of my thoughts that i know will find opposition among the followers of this sub

\-I didnt feel that the rest of the story except the intro was really good. I have found that AC2  story is regarded as on of the best in the series and quite unfortunatley i fail to see why. It would gladen me to have someone express why they are so fond of it. The reason I dont really enjoyed it is mainly becasue it is super forgetable. The missions are generic with not much variation, the enemies are barely fleshed out and you forget them the moment you kill them. Hell you kill multiple in such a short time span that they feel really irrelevant and unimpressive. Honestly, i dont think anyone can name me most of the main targets we kill in the game except from borgia, unless they know them from histroy or they have replayed the game so much, it has been etched to their mind.

Also, a lot of people talk about ezio's growth throughout the game. I must say....What ezio? Ezio is barely a caharacter after th","11","post"

"sameseksure","2025-03-20","The odd thing is the game portrays him as \*much\* more significant and important to Japanese history than he actually was. It portrays him as almost a savior of Japan. I'm fine with them bending history a bit (it's historical fiction, after all), but I can't help but notice the hypocricy here

Imagine the backlash if he was white. People would be calling it a colonialist narrative that in the first AC game set in Japan, the protagonist is the one white guy who happened to be there *as a footnote* in actual Japanese history. Again, Yasuke was not remotely significant in Japanese history. Include him, sure, but as a protagonist?

It would be like making a AC game set in an African country in the year 1000, and the protagonist so happens to be one white guy who was there. Progressives would be outraged if Ubisoft did this","11","comment"
"MysteriousDrD","2025-07-18","I have been playing Shadows on and off since launch and I still (obviously since I'm playing it since launch) have really enjoyed it. My biggest criticism is probably story pacing - it starts very strong and when the protagonists meet I was like ""hell yeah, let's go"". But then the first major story event I did after that was Naoe and Yasuke acting like they were old friends already, as if I had stumbled into a much more developed relationship and skipped ahead in the narrative. I think it's a bit of a downside of the open approach to taking down targets in any order, I wish there were some more linear story missions that took you around all the provinces and built up the uneasy alliance becoming a real friendship between the two of them and THEN went ""ok let's go now do whatever order you like"".

I do think that the back and forth banter and interactions they do have are really good, I just found the transition from enemies to best buds being a bit jarring. I am closing in on the end of the story now and Yasuke and Naoe's friendship feels a lot more earned with the hours behind it.","11","comment"

Setting is very beautiful, gameplay is very stylish and satisfying(some parts felt like a tarantino movie),but story was quite weak and the way it was structured make the whole thing feel very disjointed. Also ending >!felt more like end of an arc rather than the whole game,i actually like expansions that continue after the end of main story but the way it was set up in shadows was so obvious that it left a bitter taste in my mouth!<. So far every one seems to love shadows, im interested to see whether opinions change as more players finish the game.","10","comment"

I remember skipping out playing with friends on BO1 to play Brotherhood. Ever since then, I played all of the console/pc AC games.

Now, I'm really enjoying Shadows. Yasuke's leap of faith is my favorite thing in the game lol.","10","comment"
"BMOchado","2025-03-24","I think i know why and it's very simple to get there after putting thought in the right places.

Assassin's creed has always been a sorta Ninja game, but in a different place and time. That's why people always asked for it and why it was always a no brainer to do Assassin's Creed in Japan.

The rpgs don't have that feel because they didn't try to, they wanted something different, and ended up doing the medjay/misthios/viking experience instead of the assassin one. Fundamentally, by trying to make the Ninja experience for shadows, they inadvertently also returned the Assassin DNA to the franchise and more specifically to the RPG format.

Safe to say, the problem wasn't rpg, the problem was not having assassin's creed.

And the thing is, i don't think it was initially intended, i think they wanted to make the Ninja game because it's in Japan, same as they did the Viking for England.
Unknowingly, and unaware of the Assassin and Ninja parallels, they made an assassin's creed game again.

The idea behind it is the same as the other RPGs, but the execution turned out different, because Ninja=Assassin","10","comment"
"eivor_wolf_kissed","2025-06-30","Naoe and Yasuke had arcs? They had literally zero character development or direction whatsoever for 90% of the game, and by the time the game actually attempts something with both its already Act 3 and their goals have been wrapped up. I feel like they could have been great in concept but the execution of them as well as the story as a whole was aimless for the majority of the game and then rushed to completion near the end","9","comment"
"MultiMarcus","2025-10-24","I won’t call them that, but I think Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit for still really rolling with their proprietary engines and delivering visual fidelity that matches or exceeds stuff like unreal engine five and even the greats like Indiana Jones in some ways. Star Wars outlaws I think is the prettiest game I’ve ever played, avatar is also incredible looking. Shadows looks stunning. Honestly they deliver some incredible stuff on a graphical level but instead of doing what unreal engine does they manage to get it running very well on really utilising the full hardware it’s given. The snowdrop titles are deliciously multi threaded they use basically every single core you give it. They also scale these games down quite well.  The snow drop titles use hardware RT so they aren’t really great on something like the steam deck but shadows runs well enough on the steam deck.","9","comment"
"Thank_You_Aziz","2025-03-22","The usual people whining about a black man swinging a sword in Japan have gone into full panic mode. They’ve spent 10 months trying to run damage control on normal people possibly thinking Yasuke is cool, and it didn’t work. The game is popular and well-received, and people are speaking positively of its protagonists. If anything, the manufactured controversy only served to provide a Streisand Effect and put eyes on it. 

Now these people have taken to necro’ing threads from months ago, spamming why they don’t think Yasuke should be allowed all over again, like they can turn public opinion if they lie hard enough when it’s far too late. Seriously, have any of you been getting pings today for replies to comments you made in appreciation of this game ages ago, from people you’ve never seen before? Cuz I have, repeatedly. It’s absurd.

It’s the last flails of their denial.

Anyway, on to more fun facts. Did you know Yasuke was portrayed as a samurai in works of Japanese live action media, going as far back at least as 1996? That’s 5 years before Wikipedia existed! Also, little-known tidbit: Did you know Yasuke is in Guilty Gear Strive? Turns out, Nagoriyuki isn’t simply based on or inspired by Yasuke, but his backstory only makes sense if he *is* Yasuke. Just, you know, as an immortal vampire in the magical post-apocalypse. And finally, did you know Assassin’s Creed established that the Jesuit who brought Yasuke to Japan—Alessandro Valignano—was a Templar, roughly 10 years ago? They were laying the groundwork for this game for a while!","9","comment"
"villainized","2025-03-31","23h in, still haven't left Yamashiro. I've hit every viewpoint & question mark on the map in the first 2 provinces.

Exploration isn't very rewarding in the sense that besides the question marks on the map that lead to kofuns or anything, there's no real point in going off the beaten path, since exploring in forest areas is difficult since you can't climb much of it & there's no loot out there. The devs intended for us to stay on the roads, so that makes sense, but it is somewhat of a let down personally.

You can Spartan kick enemies with Yasuke, there's even a trophy for it, called ""This is Japan, actually"".

I agree with the side quests, Odyssey had so many random quests that were lighthearted & different from the main story, like that one where you had to find ingredients to make essentially Viagra for this woman to give to her lover, while so far most of the side jobs in this game are about bandits, & the occasional fetch quest. Granted, I haven't done too many of them so that may change. This game does seem to be darker than Odyssey, so I can't say it's super unexpected.

Lots of QoL stuff got removed which is a confusing choice from the devs, like the auto horse riding to your destination. Hopefully they put that back.

I just finished act 1 in the story, the rest of my play time has been exploring/clearing castles & I've been having a blast with the combat, particularly Naoe's. I think Shadows is easily a top 5 AC game, but it's definitely not perfect.","9","comment"
"soer9523","2025-03-29","Yup. I am loving the game but this might be my biggest criticism of it. It robs the writing of any opportunity for character development, outside of the opening and ending. The main game being about hunting one target after the other is nothing new. It’s been a thing since the first game. But it used to be in a set order so that there would be a narrative through line from one to the next. The protagonist could learn and improve as the game went on, and the antagonist would react to your actions. 

Now you get no development in the middle of the story, and antagonists will never acknowledge that potentially all their other allies have recently been killed.  

Ubisoft have become way to reliant on this structure in my opinion. Far cry 5, far cry 6, assassins creed Valhalla, mirage and now shadows all follow this path and it leads to overall unimpressive narratives.","9","comment"
"BipolarTaichiMaster","2025-04-04","[Thoughts on Shadows from someone who skipped Valhalla] The last Assassin's Creed game I played was Odyssey. I skipped Origins because, now that I'm thinking about it, I must not have liked the idea of it going in an RPG direction (I played all of them before that).

I stumbled upon a review from a video game reviewer who had limited time to invest in actually playing games because... he spends so much time playing games! He said he invested more than 100 hours in Odyssey because it was so fun. That convinced to buy it and... I loved it! In the end I got overwhelmed by the amount of things to do, never finished it, and moved on to other games, but I'm sure I'm going to revisit it (I'm actually planning on revisiting all of the ""modern"" games now).

I skipped Valhalla mostly based on feedback from my wife. I actually really haven't read much about it. I just know that it's perhaps even longer than Odyssey through actually having more content or feeling longer... Anyhow, seems like it's longer in a bad way.

On to the thoughts!

**I like focus on objectives.** I was initially annoyed that I couldn't mark multiple objectives, but then I realized that must have been a design choice and it's one I like. I have a vague memory of having multiple things on my compass in Odyssey which probably led to feeling overwhelmed. This game forces me to choose one thing and then I can mark ""?s"" or viewpoints that are on the way. One main focus with ""side quests"".

**I like how ""weak"" Naoe is.** Something that happens in Odyssey is you get REALLY OP. Like... Super duper OP. I didn't do any of the DLC, but my wife did and she got even MORE OP. In the end I stopped sneaking into castles and just burst into them and destroyed everyone (plus I remember crazy cheese with the eagle). I'll admit that Naoe starts getting a OP as well, but I'm already planning my max difficulty no HUD Naoe focused second playthrough.

**I like how OP Yasuke is.** I thought I was going to unlock him and ignore him because he's not an ""assassin"" but I'm highly enjoying his play style. I honestly might bump the difficulty during this playthrough because of how strong he is but... It's fun. It actually has me thinking about Valhalla more because I was worried about the viking character not being enough of an assassin but I'm clearly OK with that.

**I appreciate the castle design.** Clearing castles is a huge part of the game and they are designed really well. There are a ton of stealth options for Naoe and Yasuke is forced to move from area to area clearing everything out. One of the reasons I'll be going through the game twice is so I can enjoy the castles with each character once. I'm saving the more challenging experience for Naoe (I'll also self nerf if she starts feeling OP on max difficulty).

**I like the dense trees and forced pathing.** This is something else I didn't initially like because in Odyssey you could basically run in a straight line from point A to B 100% of the time. Now I enjoy all of the scenery and details during the ride. I also like that it forces you through enemy camps sometimes. The dense forest is also more representative of what traveling would have been like (I'm assuming). There's also a meta-game of deciding you're going to try to force your way from A to B anyway which usually involves needing to ditch your horse or, if you're really unlucky, getting softlocked. lol

**I appreciate the level of detail of areas that seem like they will never be connected to the story.** There a lot of situations where this comes to mind, but I'm specifically thinking about all of the temples. Initially I saw collecting those pages as a tedious waste of time, but now I see it as a mechanic to explore the temple and appreciate the work that was done to create it. There are also a bunch of temples with no pages to collect that just look cool.

**I like the full armor sets.** I have a bad memory with video games, but I'm pretty sure in Odyssey that if I wanted to be properly dripped I had to run around looking for matching pieces (helmet, chest, arms, and legs?) That was annoying. And you had to level them all up individually I think.

**The drip!** I've actually taken the time to customize my weapons to match the armor that I like and... That's not something I usually do. I've never bought a skin in my life and I'm considering dropping real world money on skins if they drop something I like (the current ones are over the top, I just want some slick ninja shit). I think I'm able to enjoy the drip in this game because it's really cool and doesn't require any extra work to look good.

**No eagle!** While proof reading I made a comment about the eagle and realized I didn't even mention such a big change. I like no eagle. The eagle was OP. It's funny because I was actually on team eagle and when I read about the eagle nerfing in Valhalla that also made me uninterested in it. Now, playing with no eagle, I like it.

I suppose those are the main tho","9","post"
"No_Duck4805","2025-04-22","I hate it, and I love exploration in most open world games. Thank GOD they added the follow mechanism.

It’s not fun but I can still enjoy the story.","9","comment"
"Zayl","2025-03-24","If Shadows wasn't made by Ubisoft it would easily be sitting in the 90s with reviewers and everyone would be singing it's praises.

It is actually an insanely good game. The weather system is the best I've ever seen and it's not even close, the graphics and general world design are amazing, the forests are dense and oppressive. The world is 100% the main character in this.

But then, the combat is actually fun and serviceable to both old and new AC players (just turn it to easy if you just wanna counter-kill everything). The animations are incredible, and the stealth is near perfect. Reminds me so much of MGSV/Splinter Cell.

Lastly, the story is surprisingly very good. I was not a fan of Odyssey or Syndicate from a plot perspective (Odyssey has to be the worst written game in the franchise IMO) but Shadows is fucking great so far. The characters are good, you get so much backstory, and there's actually cinematics finally.","9","comment"
"-SirThief-","2025-05-01","The order of the Onryo members you need to hunt down makes no sense as well. In Origins the OotA were organized in a clear path that took you across nearly the whole open world. There were a few areas you could explore on your own that the main stroy didn't take you to, but overall it still felt like you were on a clear path. 

With Shadows, its all over the place. I'm 70 hours in, halfway done with the main story targets, haven't been to Tamba or Kii yet. Don't spoil me, but I'm not even sure I'll ever go there in the main story. 

This sort of design is handicapping the game INCREDIBLY. It does a disservice to frankly the most beautiful open world I've ever played to have no narrative motivation to go to certain places.

Like the Noble questline has you exploring Hajime. And you ONLY stay in Hajime. Its baffling how some of the narrative elements were organized.","9","comment"

"TheJoshider10","2025-03-13","> Or the fact that there has been a lot of Japanese-themed action RPGs lately.

It's this for me. What I love about AC games is that they often explore parts of history and locations that I've never seen elsewhere or not in such a high focus/detail. I feel like for all their faults you're guaranteed a fun, unique open world to wander around despite the Ubisoft-isms.

Shadows to me just looks like Ghost of Tsushima. If it's not Tsushima then it's Like A Dragon: Ishin. If it's not Ishin then it's Rise of the Ronin. No matter what Shadows shows off, I can't help but feel like I've been to this world before. I'm sure it'll still be a good game and I'll enjoy playing it, but fans spent about 15 years begging for them to release a game in this time period and it took them long enough to the point it's been done before.

That said, maybe this will lower expectations and make it more enjoyable since I can be pleasantly surprised by what I see in the game. But it won't have the initial excitement that other AC games have given me.","9","comment"
"JLtheking","2025-03-27","It wasn’t obvious to me either, but I think that’s the point. 

Naoe is meant to be a stand in for the player. Secrets have been kept from her throughout her entire life. She was trained to be a shinobi and inducted into the assassin’s creed during a time of crisis, but she hasn’t been taught the broader political ramifications of it and why her town was being attacked.

And the story told through the rest of the game is us discovering that history through her eyes at the same time as her.","9","comment"

Black Flag? It's a pirate game, pirates weren't a specific race.

Same thing with Rogue, Shay is a Templar and the game is set in the North Atlantic. 

The only one that makes sense is Revelations, and even then, it was a continuation of Ezio's story.

Also, which of those games you listed have you playing as a historical figure as the protagonist? Oh right, none.

Yasuke being the protagonist of this game is simple and blatant tokenism, it's gross. Nothing wrong with Yasuke being in the game, but have him be a character you meet, and have the two protagonists be works of fiction you play as.","8","comment"
"harna","2025-07-24","[40 hours into shadows, honest review] Very pretty game, but assassins creed has gone too far down the MMORPG route of overstating weapons, abilities etc and then just doing level scaling alongside it so all those numbers don't matter.  
  
Instead of character and enemy levels, just lock areas you don't want us to reach early, because it's not fun brute forcing through anything anyway  
  
Instead of levelled weapons and armour and then level scaled enemies to match (aka the scale is never in our favour), don't punish us for not wanting to change weapons every 5 minutes - just balance by having aesthetic changes if you really want. Back in AC2 for example, my weapons damage, speed, deflect were just from 1 star to 5 stars, and as I got better at the game over time, I got better at parrying and fighting and didn't need my character's weapon to level up, I levelled up my skills! It felt satisfying to find the tombs and get the armour of Altair, and that reward of my hard work lasted the whole game onwards then - in this there's always a new best armour  
  
The game is ""Assassins"" creed, but now and again I'm forced to play Geralt from The Witcher with less satisfying combat mechanics - if I want to be a bruiser and swing a big sword around I'd play a different game. All for different play styles, but don't make it mandatory to swap between them - the only reason it worked in syndicate was because both characters actually felt somewhat similar and notably, both felt like assassins to some degree.  
  
The only time so far I've found a decent moment of the two characters was when they were attacking a certain location with a target in it, and you could choose between Yasuke and Naoe for each of the 3 simultaneous stages:   
\- the initial frontal assault, or the sneaking over the walls   
\- the freeing of prisoners, or duelling a representative of your target   
\- and finally killing the target by whichever fighting style you preferred   
That's how it should be done as I still got to play the way I wanted when I did. 

Both characters should be able to do everything the other can do - Naoe can't lift oil pots. I spent 15 minutes working out how to get into a tomb prior to being able to swap to Yasuke, and no hint or prompt to help me?

In non-canon mode or when both the main characters appear in a cutscene, you didn't need me to open my inventory, swap character to start the cutscene - (just for me to swap back immediately after). If you need me to swap desperately for some urgent gameplay mechanic swap me - and if you don't let me start the cutscene as whomever and when it ends put me in as the same character, all you've done is take me more out of the moment with a load screen and some random season change.  
  
I've paid for it so I'm going to complete it, but the further I progress the less I enjoy it","8","post"

"Askyl","2025-07-24","My very short review: The game is great. Looks great. Feels great. With canon mode + immersive mode the story is great. But I expect more from Assassins Creed than great. Ac2 blew my mind. The entire Ezio trilogy was an instant Classic. Black Flag was far ahead other pirate-like games. Unity (story a bit meh) was visually incredible and the parkour was nailed to perfection. Origins had the best playable character in a game ever (subjective I know) and again incredible world and visuals. Odyssey felt like an actual oddysey to play. Etc.
 
Shadows have graphics and the immersive mode is cool, but graphics isnt as impressive anymore because a lot of games have it. Assassins Creed is supposed to make me wanna put on a hoodie and feel fucking badass doing so, even if I am only a few years shy of 40. While also pushing technological boundaries of gaming. They just dont anymore.

But obviously the journalists have to cherrypick the one part of the conversation where they talked about cultural representation.

Anyone who's actually watched the full interview should know there's nothing wrong with what she actually says. It's the fact that the person interviewing goes out of their way to ask a very SPECIFIC question that I'm assuming they hoped would invoke a particular response from her.

"kfresh","2025-04-25","I absolutely believe that Yasuke was originally intended to be a mid-game ""surprise!"" switch-up to playing as the character originally pegged as a bad-guy in Naoe's story. At some point during development they realised they weren't going to have enough content to justify that or make it work, and they ended up re-shuffling some of the story (Naoe's past and flashback sequences specifically) and added Yasuke to the marketing of the game.

Imagine playing the first (non-tutorial) mission as Yasuke when you were under the impression he was going to be an enemy, rolling through a castle of soldiers to save Naoe. It was already good, but would have had ten times the impact if it was a surprise reveal.

There's just this undertow of ""they cut so much out here"" around the whole game.","8","comment"

I cannot take you seriously when you're saying that Shadows feels clunky when you're comparing it with the clunky skeleton of Valhalla that's still present in mirage or ghost of Tsushima.

This is one of the best stealth experiences of all time. It's very responsive. Idk what your hardware problem is, but on series x it plays perfectly.

"Wavehead21","2025-09-17","The reason I’m most sad they’re leaving the Isu out of AC Shadows is that it would have been such a cool opportunity to lean into Japanese gods and legends! I can appreciate that each game has different degrees of Isu lore, and after Odyssey and Valhalla, I can understand dialing it back a bit! But leaving it out altogether feels criminal. A lot of the changes and details we noted late in the production cycle seemed to be aimed at “authenticity and respecting the culture”, as if there’s a big target in Ubi’s back to respect Japanese culture more than any other. But leaving out Japanese mythology seems like the opposite of embracing the culture! Why do the Greeks and Norse get this cultural embrace, but not the Japanese? 

And yeah it’s notably the only main series game with zero Isu content! Heck even Libration had some a first Civ temple! It doesn’t have to be much; we don’t need to meet the Isu in game, or have pieces of Eden as equitable weapons and armor. Just give us a legendary artifact or two as a plot point, some lost temple to explore, references to the gods and an implication of them actually living on earth, anything! Sure, not every protagonist has to have Met God, much less BE one, but the complete lack of Isu references makes Shadows feel less connected to the series plot. I’m starting to think I can actually just skip this game.","7","comment"
"bobo0509","2025-07-19","I find the writing/characters actually better and more memorable than the exploration aspect in AC Shadows. I find the open world pretty weak since it copied all the very generic and quick lazy stuff from Tsushima that so much people praised, with only few exceptions that are the rare good things like the puzzle caves (dont remember the name). On the other hand a lot of the moments of Nao and Yasuke were pretty neat and i really love the voice acting (in Japanese), some cutscenes and characters were memorable, all of that.

But yes the real good stuff about this game is the stealth and combat, it's simply the ebst it has ever been in an AC by far i would say, and i can clear castle and camps over and over without being tired because it always feels good. They really really nailed the Ninja assassin fantasy part with Naoe honestly, and it's all what really mattered.","7","comment"
"DarkImpacT213","2025-03-23","Hell, even with France they were much more on the stereotypical side (and made them speak in British accents in the English version), and that's with Ubisoft being a French company. 

To me, all the AC's feel relatively unique and distinct from a cultural point of view though to be honest. Greece does feel like Greece in Odyssey, Norway feels like Norway in Valhalla, the Danelaw feels like the Danelaw in Valhalla, and London feels like London in Syndicate. I do agree that they seemed to have been extra careful with Shadows - I'm fairly certain that it is because for some reason Japanese history has diehard fans that cry about every single inaccuracy while the European history enjoyers are fine with whatever stylized version the market provides them with.","7","comment"

Kinda like an hour or two on Yasuke, with the story leading up to a certain hooded woman assassinating Nobunaga who you have to confront. Good replay value at the least! ","7","comment"
"[deleted]","2025-05-20","My sole issue with Shadows about 20-30 hours into the game is the writing. And I don't mean what's written, but rather how it's been written. I understand the coolness factor of not having a quest tab, and the idea to expand on top of the investigation tab from Mirage, but the lack of polish in the story beats plus the sheer scale of the story and the world compared to Mirage makes me feel like there's just no main quest to the story. At no point do I have any gut feeling whether I'm near some narrative culmination or things are still brewing. 

There's just a ton of mini Orders and they all have at least 5-8 members you're supposed to investigate and assassinate, and with that many people it's just hard to care about all of them. It makes me care about none of them. It becomes a routine of sending scouts, then going there to tick off a box.

Sure, there's a ton of interesting side stories, and the moments where you switch between Naoe and Yasuke in the main quest (usually when taking on one of the Shinbakufu) are really great but it's just not enough to call this  a saga. I've cleaned up Settsu, Yamashiro, Omi and Iga and this feels way more like a sandbox game than a story driven RPG.","7","comment"

All of the shinbakfu we are never given reasons as to why they are bad people. (Take AC1 the doctor templar guy we watch him break the legs of a guy brutally)

The story apart from beginning and end is a utterly incoherent mess because the player can complete it in any order. (that's like me choosing to read Harry Potter and starting on the Goblet of fire and then jumping to Philosophers stone it makes Zero Sense)

Whoever wrote naoes story should be fired. Why isn't she just a Assassin you could have a had a maternal teacher dynamic with Tsyyu being her mentor but no we just had to make Naoe a proto Assassin when her story is only 50 years after Ezio you just gotta love Ubisoft drip feeding the words templar and Assassin instead of actually writing a decent story.

Yasukes story is much better in my opinion and I enjoyed his more as his felt as if it had a good conclusion that being said he and Naoe should have more conflict then they do considering Yasuke incessantly praises and Looks up to a man who practically genocided Naoes entire Province

But it's the best we've had in awhile and I feel as though we're getting somewhere but for godsake do not hire someone to write the story unless they've played all the originals and know the Lore.","7","comment"
"Warskull","2025-03-26","It is because they know they can't do as good as Valhalla and they know they will be fighting that battle when the earnings report comes out. They are trying to lay the groundwork for a fight they can win.

Ubisoft's financials and stock has been taking hits and the investors are looking to oust Yves Guillemot. They already tried once. With Star Wars and Avatar not meeting expectations Shadows is going to be a big fight for them. Investors are going to point to the budget, the delays, and compare the sales to previous games. Top management needs to convince the investors they should still be in charge.

Articles talking about how no one can meet COVID numbers helps them. They need to present the narrative that the sales numbers are the best they could have been, regardless of what the numbers turn out to be. Good, but not good enough is a situation they can end up being in.","7","comment"
"ImmortalThunderGod79","2025-04-04","Ahahaha true, I share similar sentiments -- you right there is a lot of Samurai and Ninja games that like to make Nobunaga often the punching bag bad guy which can entertaining and fun if done right lol 

As for their last comment - I actually made a historical write up on Nobunaga last year [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cx5mo8/historical_analysis_of_oda_nobunaga_japans_first/) if you interested. 

Yes his depiction in Shadows is actually pretty close to how he is in history - a man with strengths, flaws and ambitions while still having its own unique Assassin's Creed spin to him...  

I also felt for Nobunaga too - the man came so close to unifying Japan, but then goddamn Akechi Mitsuhide ruined everything for him - as he played both him and Naoe rofl...","7","comment"
"Zarir-","2025-09-11","The patches look great, but ngl I'm a bit concerned about some of the additions in regards to balancing.

> To support the launch of the Claws of Awaji expansion we've raised the level cap to 100, giving players more room to grow and more options to customize their builds.  

It took a NG+ playthrough for me to get to level 80 from 60, so I'm a bit concerned if Claws of Awaji has enough content/xp to reach 100. There's also an achievement for reaching level 80 so they'll probably add one for 100 too.

> By upgrading the Forge to level 6, Naoe and Yasuke gain the ability to enhance their gear to new quality tiers: Mythic and Artifact. Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential. 

I was expecting just a single level, not 9. At higher levels upgrading eats up a lot of resources, so I'm wondering how expensive it would be for a single item to get the max level, lot alone a whole set of gear. Imo the game isn't hard enough to require anything beyond what we already have so I'm wondering if this is just a resource sink to push selling resources from the store.

> These powerful enhancements are designed as long-term goals, supporting players through the increasing difficulty of subsequent New Game+ cycles and other upcoming challenges.  

This just adds more to my concern. It's nice there's something to progress towards with multiple NG+ runs, but the game is already super long. How many people are actually going to NG+ multiple times? Did Ubisoft add 9 levels with the need to complete multiple NG+ runs in mind? One run is like 60 hours. But most of all I'm just concerned they'll make upgrading a piece of gear to the max level an achievement and I personally do not want to play the entire game multiple times just for one achievement.","7","comment"
"CriesAboutSkinsInCOD","2025-03-27","Good for them. Well deserved.

I fucking love Naoe and Yasuke and this beautiful world! I especially love Naoe's English voice over. 

Kassandra was my favorite character in all of the AC titles and now Naoe is up there with her! Ubisoft Quebec made both Odyssey and Shadows so we are very likely to get a Kassandra crossover into Shadows. If Valhalla had Kassandra we will get her in Shadows for sure. (I hope)

Now we just need more QoL patches and some great DLCs.

One of the big standout with Shadows has to be the Ubisoft Anvil engine updates and leaving last-gen consoles behind really helps with that.

"TheSilencer6491","2025-05-19","This is an amazing game, especially if your into Japanese culture and of course samurai also shinobi type stuff. I wouldn’t listen to the haters, the game is incredible and maybe the best looking I’ve ever seen. The seasons change which is a very cool dynamic, for instance if it’s winter the water is frozen to ice also the bushes and trees will lose leaves. I mean you can even watch the snow stick. Further more the stealth is better than ever, with the ability to prone now. Parkour is fun with Naoe as she has a grappling hook and she’s incredibly quick like a cat. Yasuke on the other hand is slow as can be, yet very effective in combat. He’s a brute and pushes through everything, no very nimble or stealthy as he can break walking ropes lol. All in all this is a solid game, coming from a guy who’s favorite is Brotherhood and has beat every main installment in the series. I’d rank this top 3 all time, mine would go Brotherhood, Shadows and AC2. The order doesn’t matter, yet brotherhood has always been my all time. This has the smoothest gameplay and best graphics of the entire series. It’s the most fun to just flat out play and my god is it long. I’ve done most of the side stuff and I just got to act 3, the final. I’m like over 110 hours in, no ac game has ever taken me this long as Valhalla took around 88 hours. This is a long journey, but one well worth it in my eyes. I hope you read this and for you or anyone, maybe perhaps it will bring you to AC Shadows.","7","comment"
"Hyyunckel","2025-06-30","[(SPOILER about the story and characters) after 90 hours here's my review of ac shadows.] 

I really enjoyed my time with \*Assassin’s Creed Shadows\*, easily sunk 90+ hours into it. I’m a big fan of the RPG-style AC games—except \*Valhalla\*. I loved both Naoe and Yasuke, and the story (for the most part) worked for me. I even saved watching the \*Shōgun\* TV series to enhance the immersion while playing.



There’s definitely a mix of positives and negatives here. I was hoping Ubisoft Québec would scratch that \*Odyssey\* itch since they developed \*Shadows\*, but they didn’t quite deliver.



 Positives:



\* First off, the open world was amazing. The atmosphere, the visuals—everything felt next-gen. When it rained, it actually felt like I was there. The seasonal changes were a nice touch too. I think they nailed Japan as a setting. While it's not in my top 5 AC settings, the world itself was still really well done.



\* I really liked Naoe and Yasuke. Both are way better protagonists than Eivor. One of the biggest reasons I hated \*Valhalla\* was Eivor—dude had no sense of direction, just blindly followed his brother like a damn puppy. But Naoe and Yasuke? Their backstories were great, their arcs were solid, and they had clear missions.



\* Gameplay was top-tier as usual. Naoe’s stealth might be a hot take, but to me, she’s the best pure stealth assassin in the whole franchise. Playing as her? Chef’s kiss. Yasuke is a straight-up tank, and I loved switching between them for balanced gameplay.



\* I really enjoyed the ally missions too—especially Junjiro. Loved that kid. His dynamic with Yasuke and Naoe was touching and gave more heart to the story.



Negatives:



\* One of my biggest issues: the side quests are a goddamn mess. When people online said it was just bounty boards with targets and no substance, I was worried. But I told myself, “Hey, you love killing targets, you’ll be fine.” Man, I was wrong. I got bored as hell. Like, what the fuck happened to real side quests? I don’t mind killing targets, but give them \*some\* story, some context. They should’ve condensed and mixed those with meaningful side content. They really fumbled the bag here.



\* Act 2 of the story was boring. The Shogunate (or Shinbakufu, whatever) was a useless organization. I get that the Templars were the real villains, but the Shogunate should’ve been developed better. Instead of making the Templars feel like a side quest exclusive to Yasuke, they should’ve been tied directly into the main story. Overall, Shinbakufu felt pointless. And honestly, I’d take the Cult of Kosmos over them any day—they were better written and more memorable. Ubisoft Québec \*created\* the Cult, so I don’t know why they didn’t use that as a benchmark.



\* Romance options? Trash. Straight up. They somehow got worse. Choices didn’t matter—classic Ubisoft. Just like their other RPGs, no real consequences. They seriously need to study \*The Witcher 3\* when it comes to narrative choice and romance.







When the game was about to launch, I was hyped and ready to pay full price. But my friend convinced me to wait for reviews or a possible discount, and thank fuck I listened. I don’t say this to be rude—I'm a fan of AC and especially the RPG entries—but \*Shadows\* honestly feels like a $30–$40 game at best. That said, I’m still excited for the DLCs and to see where the story goes next.","7","post"
"LudevicusMagnus3000","2025-04-15","Knowing Ubisoft, it could very well be the case. 

Actually assassin’s creed odyssey had a similar bug, a bug no one talked about when the game was released because no one knew there was supposed to be a lot more chatter in the cities, like in the busy neighbourhoods of Athens for example. 

It was only THREE YEARS LATER, when they released the final « big » patch of the game, the one that came with a crossover/epilogue quest with valhalla, that some players realized that the crowds were suddenly a lot more noisy, with an increased sensation of « liveliness » in the cities, with a deg admitting that they casually patched this bug right then.

So i guess for shadows we just have to wait several years for a complete experience ?","7","comment"

Oddly enough, I feel like the only other game that nailed the assassin fantasy like this was Chronicles China (underrated gem).. Shadows reminded me a lot of that game mixed with Unity!","7","comment"
"eBulla","2025-03-31","I’m around 40hrs in, and I like the game, but it’s not my top game so far. I find Valhalla is still my fave, followed by Odyssey, then Origins for its incredible story, then Shadows.

I find the combat is not as fun for me as Valhalla’s. It’s more linear, and you have less control. You chain skills that do the combat for you, giving you the illusion of control, but really you are just guiding the character. Valhalla’s and even Odysseys combat was much more meaningful and controlled by the player.

I do not enjoy the more linear traveling. I miss being able to cut across the map, climbing any obstacle in my path, and finding cool things along the way! You are more forced along the games chosen path, instead of your own. Though the game is beautiful, so I do enjoy the paths to an extent. There is much less loot in the world as well. I’m constantly scanning for loot like you would in Valhalla, yet the world is empty. It’s more a painted canvas than an explorable world.

I really miss the torches! Exploring tombs is much less fun in all the darkness. I light all the candles I see, but I find I accidentally destroy more than I light, especially with Yasuke, the big oaf!

The story was good at first, but it’s trailed off. I was doing all the side quests and hideout quests, that the story disappeared for me. I had to force myself back into the main quests to try and find the story again.

It’s a pretty good game, and definitely a beautiful game, but not the best. I find myself yearning to play Valhalla again, as I play shadows.

Edit: I also dislike the cities. In previous games the cities were bustling! Sadly in this game, the cities are kinda dead, nobody talks, everyone is just standing around not moving. It doesn’t feel like I’m in a city, just a boring part of the game.","7","comment"
"AvasAdventures_","2025-05-19","[Assassin’s Creed Shadows – Disappointed Long-Time Fan Review] I’ve played and enjoyed multiple Assassin’s Creed titles (Odyssey, Valhalla, Origins) and other exploration-based action RPGs like Horizon Forbidden West and Immortals Fenyx Rising. I was really looking forward to Shadows, but unfortunately, it’s been one of the most frustrating and disappointing experiences in the franchise for me.

Traversal is clunky and frustrating.
The open-world design looks beautiful at first, but once you start exploring, it falls apart:
	•	You constantly slide down rocks because the characters can’t grip to surfaces properly — unlike previous games.
	•	Fields are overgrown with grass and bamboo, which might look realistic, but they make visibility horrible. You can’t see where you’re going, where enemies are, or even how to approach your next objective.
	•	The horse is basically useless. It’s impossible to navigate properly in many areas due to the terrain and visibility, so you end up running everywhere anyway — slowly.

The camera makes combat a chore.
	•	During battles, the camera shifts way too quickly, making it hard to track enemies.
	•	The lock-on system is clunky and unreliable, especially when surrounded.
	•	Combat itself doesn’t feel satisfying — you’re either being overwhelmed by too many enemies at once, or left whittling down health bars with little strategy involved.

Forced character switching ruins immersion.
	•	The constant switching between Yasuke and Naoe isn’t enjoyable. It breaks the flow of the game, especially if you prefer one style over the other.
	•	You don’t get the option to stay with a preferred playstyle — you’re pushed into one or the other depending on the mission.

The hideout is a nightmare.
	•	Simply exiting the hideout can take 10 minutes. The design and layout are unintuitive and make basic tasks feel like a time sink.

Progression feels stagnant.
	•	There are hardly any meaningful checkpoints or opportunities to level up.
	•	Gaining new weapons or gear is slow, and objectives are often swamped with high-density enemy encounters that are hard to get through — especially when everyone’s at the same level as you.
	•	It’s easy to get stuck running around in circles, trying (and failing) to get just slightly better.

Overall:
This game had so much potential, but the mechanics, pacing, and frustrating systems make it a chore to play. It feels like a major step backward for the franchise.","6","post"
"Kimkonger","2025-03-27","Really enjoying the game but it can get very easy on expert for both combat and stealth very quick! Especially once you get used to enemy behavior and unlock some abilities and skills as well as make even a simple build! It becomes hilariously easy that it breaks immersion and engagement. You can take out many bossess who the game hypes up before they even get through their in combat monologue! Again, i AM enjoying the game a lot, much more than any previous AC but the difficulty feels like it's blue balling me from the perfect most enagging stealth/combat experience i dream of. It get's close, closer than any AC but it's not quite there for me! Hear me out and bare with the long post....The main criticisms i have of the game are as follows ...

On expert stealth, it's still too easy to lose enemies after they have spotted you and there's not much consequence to it. How alert and reactive they are is very engaging especially with no HUD but you can still disengage combat and re-engage stealth very easily! This is where they still end up feeling feeling as dumb as previous games. They should add a master stealth difficulty where if you are spotted by an enemy or a servant manages to alert a guard, enemies do not go back to normal even after you lose them. They should alert other guards and search for you . If you lose them, they should remain in a moderate alert status where they are constantly searching and checking hiding spots and be even more alert to movement/sound while being more likely to deny your assassinations from the front. It should be the same if they spot a dead body! They should only go back to normal when you leave the region or after a 6 hour cycle of in game time, which would be around 30 minutes of real time. This would really make needing to stay in the shadows and not alert anyone, as well as hiding bodies or booby trapping them much more important and meaningful! Especially because there is no actual chase mechanic and enemies don't climb to pursue you! 

When not in a hostile area, enemies are also very unpresponsive. They only react to you if you draw your weapon and they have this cool interaction where they ask you to sheathe it and you can refuse or comply. I've also seen that if they find a dead body in a none hostile area and find you close to it, they will actually question you and you can confess/lie with Naoe or Confess/threaten with Yasuke. If you lie with Naoe or confess with Yasuke you can get away, and the enemies react differently, getting afraid and leaving the scene with Yasuke if he confesses or telling Naoe to move along if she lies, and i think if you don't get away they fight you. These are really cool but i would like them to be more reactive to other stuff you do in the open world as well. Like in the cities they should have the same reactions if you parkour around or break stuff while moving with both characters. Many times in the open world i find that enemies aren't as reactive and you can run into them, hit them with your horse and even approach and assassinate them from the front while they are doing what seems to be official business. On a new master stealth difficulty, their dynamic reactions even outside of hostile/restriced areas should be extended to how you behave. This would immerese players in the general culture of Japan where you aren't meant to disturb the peace!

For combat, they need a master difficulty as well where enemies are faster, more aggressive and have tighter perfect dodge/parry windows. This would make for more fast paced engaging combat that rewards skill rather than just you being better because you do more damage and can tank more hits! You should also not have auto health regeneration when you are out of combat which would make rations matter more! As it is, you can just run away and regen health, then come back, there's also plenty of rations everywhere. Heck there's even builds that make you basically unkillable where you gain health without needing to use rations!!

People may disagree and say the game is hard enough on expert and that ""this is not sekiro"" but in all honesty they are probably feeling this way because they haven't yet gotten used to the combat and haven't gotten many of the mid knowledge/mastery level skills that basically break combat! You get OP so fast in this game that you won't even need to engage or use many of the rather dynamic combo's and weapon gimmicks. You can get by most fights with the same things you were doing in the tutorial with a couple of upgrades and abililties which imo is not engaging at all, even for casual players. For anyone who even tries to master simple combos and the ridiculously generous perfect parry/dodge windows, they will be able to take out any enemy that's higher level without any abilities or upgrading damage. It will just be a chore to do so. This shouldn't be the case especially for expert difficulty!","6","comment"

But yeah I was the same as you too.. I didn't really have that many high expectations with Shadows, but with the game finally being out and being able to experience the story... Yeah I was pleasantly surprised especially by how they handled Nobunaga - one of my favorite Japanese historical figures ever. 

They told a narrative about him that fits within the context of the Assassin's Creed mythos while also being generally faithful with how he was generally depicted in history. He was a standout character amongst the cast of characters in AC Shadows and I couldn't be any happier. 

And yes the actor who voiced and played him in the game is phenomenal, he perfectly embodied Nobunaga's charisma, eccentricism, ruthlessness and nobility... You could tell Ubi Quebec did their research on him quite well...","6","comment"
"MartianMule","2025-05-13","I enjoyed the game.  The story isn't anything spectacular, but it's fine.  The world was fun to explore; it's absolutely gorgeous, and the changing seasons adds a lot to it, imo.  I really want more games to implement that.  Just in terms of exploration, it's up there with Black Flag for me. 

And I enjoyed the combat a lot.  It's definitely my favorite gameplay wise of the newer style games.  Both standard combat (which feels more grounded, no more magical spears or fire weapons) and stealth (probably my favorite stealth since Unity; taking down castles as Naoe is a ton of fun).  

Out of the 14 AC games, it's probably top 5 for me, or at least close to it.  I did enjoy it more than Mirage, Valhalla, or Odyssey (which I did still enjoy). 

It's not the greatest game of all time, or even of the year.  But it's still fun.","6","comment"

He was a real character whose story is not known. He was the only one of his kind. This leaves room for a lot of creative freedom for a writer. 

The issue that comes from Yasuke criticism is that it does come from a place of racism. One of the arguments I saw online was that they were complaining that a black Samurai wasn’t realistic. As if it’s not a video game series where fantasy is the main objective.","6","comment"
"MP4-B","2025-10-25","I'm surprised at the number of people saying if you liked Odyssey you'll like Shadows because I disagree.  


The two character system sucks, cool storylines for both but having to choose a playstyle isn't fun in my opinion and Yasuke is practically useless in exploration so you're railroaded into Naoe most of the time.  


The world is beautiful but there isn't much to do. Most of the ""exploration "" is putting a map marker and on and then having you're horse auto follow to that location.  The activities are boring, the side quests if you can even call them that are just go to x and kill y. Nothing like the quests in Odyssey.  Doesn't have any of the light-hearted and humorous moments Odyssey had.


The story outside of the personal storylines is extremely forgettable.  The gameplay loop is extremely repetitive even for an AC/Ubisoft game because there is so little to do and explore outside of stealth or combat.


I get that Odyssey wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but if it was, I find it hard to believe you liked Shadows.  It's like watching a silent black and white film in comparison.  Almost completely lifeless. ","6","comment"

"dunkindonato","2025-04-15",">It should've been used to ENHANCE social stealth, an existing pillar of the franchise, not try to be its own thing.

The thing with social stealth is that it works if the settings are densely populated, and unlike before, Japan doesn't have hooded monks where Naoe can blend in. The next logical step was to create a disguise mechanic (i.e. a pilgrim outfit for going to musha shugyo locations) but doing that in an overworld map can bring about some unintended results, like requiring you to change into a disguise every time you enter a territory requiring it. For longtime fans of the series (including me), it is a dream come true because it adds depth to the gameplay and adds a new dimension to the traditional concept of ""social stealth."" But for everyone else, it might become an unnecessary chore. 

>why should I do ALL of that and STILL fail to register a clean kill, because my ""hidden blade damage is not high enough""?

I think in Shadows, I feel that they mitigated that somewhat with having animations that deny the attack. It is also not hard to level up in Shadows. I managed to upgrade my Assassin abilities long before the game allowed me to switch to Yasuke. 

>I WISH they would go all the way with mechanics perceived as ""boring"" or ""tedious"".

I understand the frustration. I guess if Ubisoft (the company) isn't in so much shit that it needs to attract to a wide range of players, they might have considered putting in some ""hardcore"" elements. I do think that the devs can still add gameplay elements in future updates or DLCs. Things that we can use in a New Game plus.","6","comment"

The natives would speak in Spanish and Quechua (I think?), but Lara would reply to them in English and they all just understood it. It was not immersive at all. Immersive would've been if the dialogues could only happen because Lara also knows Spanish and Quechua and talks to them in their languages. I hope AC Shadows won't just copy this by letting Japanese people speak to Portuguese people in Japanese and vice versa but let a dialogue between multiple people happen in the same language regardless of their native languages. If a Portuguese person doesn't know Japanese, and a Japanese person doesn't know Portuguese, and they don't know another common language either, then they shouldn't be able to communicate within the story. And another thing I wonder is whether Yasuke will speak Japanese (and possibly Portuguese) with an accent, like he does in English.","5","comment"

The Assassin's Creeding was fairly poor.

I would need multiple hands to count the sheer number of times I wanted to assassinate an enemy, but instead swung my sword at nothing, like a moron; alerting them to my location and being forced into combat.


Credit where credit is due, out of the rpg AC titles, this one has the most visceral combat with proper impact on hits that feels pretty nice. But I still find it hard to care about Naoe's plight when she can spend upwards of 5 minutes eviscerating the living fuck out of a Samurai, filling entire areas with their blood and then still losing the fight from a single kick, because the number on their head was bigger than the number on hers 🙄","5","comment"
"thebluick","2025-04-25","I think you are still being overly generous to the story.  It's bad.  I thought act 1 was mid. Act 2 is abysmal.  This is the worst story in AC.  Even syndicate which I've complained about before loos like a 10/10 in comparison. 

Shadows is my lowest rated AC game so far and I've played everything but the mobile ones (plus liberation which was great).","5","comment"
"KuShiroi","2025-09-29","Shadows is one of my favorite AC ever gameplay-wise but I really don't like how they made discovery so unrewarding. Having to run around the map to each ? markers only for about half of them to be revealed as just another POI with nothing to do is just bad design. It was tedious the first time and in NG+ it's just frustrating to do it all again. They could just carry over all the map discoveries from the previous playthough and only reset the activities.","5","comment"

"smithscully","2025-03-24","You put my feelings very well. Like you, I absolutely LOVED Ghost of Tsushima, but it never felt like anything I had ever played before. It’s storytelling, environment, pacing, game play aspects, combat, and mechanics all felt incredibly fun and new and real. Yes, you get to sneak around hideouts and assassinate people, but there’s so much more to the game than just that. Playing AC Shadows feels nothing like playing GoT, and that’s not me knocking GoT. Shadows is just also a very good game, with its own unique and innovative aspects. I’m excited to see what Ghost of Yotei will be like as well. I feel lucky to be able to play so many games that take place during moments in history that are interesting to me and which offer unique gaming experiences. There’s such a weird culture in gaming where only one game can be the best game and then all the rest are bad games. As was suggested elsewhere on this sub today, unless you’ve played Elden Ring or RDR2, you’ve never played a good game (I actually have played RDR2 more than once and it’s my favourite game, but that doesn’t mean that AC Shadows isn’t also good. I tried Elden Ring and it wasn’t for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good game either). Thanks for starting a nuanced conversation.","5","comment"

But idk about these facial expressions in dialogues, imo they look very bad especially for a game of this rank, there is like no life in these dialogues, it feels very stiff, very robotic and Naoe's face looks terrible in it, some of the other NPC characters look way better but maybe it's just me, this is like the only thing that is throwing me off so far.","5","comment"
"calibur66","2025-03-29","I completed Odyssey and Valhalla when they released and honestly while I agree the side activities are less interesting (Atleast less than Valhalla's), they're also much less time consuming to do and are helped by the world looking way more beautiful than the previous entries, so having side content that gives actually important rewards and is basically a reason for exploration isn't the worst.

They could honestly have cut the number of assassination targets in half and just put that time and effort into making them all as cinematic as the main assassination targets, but they've set this bar of having all this stuff that they won't go back.

I did genuinely enjoy Orlog the first few times I playted it in Valhalla, but it also took way longer to do than anything in Shadows and the main actual ""Assassination"" gameplay of Shadows is much better than the other Modern era AC's.","5","comment"
"RayKainSanji","2025-11-25","Ive said this on almost every single update notes post...

PLEASE FIX THE ABILITY TOGGLE BUTTON MAPPING!!!

Since Ability toggle cannot be mapped out of R2 (on PS5), there is currently no way to consistently use R2 as Free Run to enable old style gameplay. There will be many times when Ability Toggle will override R2 and R1, regardless of what you map to those buttons.

Mirage has been able to use R2 as free run for so long (pretty much since release) and they just released an official button layout option that does the same. Why can't Shadows do the same?

Idk about anyone else, but unless there is some proper change in the priorities of this game...I don't think I will be returning to this game.","5","comment"

"HauntingAddendum3365","2025-09-29","I loved the stealth gameplay in Shadows. The graphics and weather system looked amazing and exploration was fun for a while, but the actual story/mission design was terrible imo. I didnt care about a single character outside of Naoe and Yasuke, and every main target felt exactly the same. Its one of the worst stories in the entire franchise, imo. 

I somehow rolled credits on the main story but upon starting new game plus I genuinely have no idea how I made it all the way through. Theres no way I'm doing all of it again. I've replayed all of the other RPG AC games and generally loved them but something about Shadows just felt so much more monotonous. 

I think its the objective board they use for missions, letting you kill main story targets in whatever order, same as Mirage (but that was much shorter and just one city!) it just makes every story mission feel repetitive and meaningless. The entire middle section of the game just feels like a chore, once you've cleared a few castles and assassinated a few targets you realize that every single one is identical. 

I'm not sure what the solution is, tbh. Mirage felt too bare-bones for me, but then Shadows felt like a completely forgettable grind for the majority of the main plot. Ubisoft gotta go back to the drawing board when it comes to their main mission structure. This whole ""clear the zones/targets in whatever order you want, for the next 20 hours"" that they've been doing for AC and Far Cry doesnt work. It makes the entire middle section of the story feel pointless and forgettable.","5","comment"

"Pricerocks","2025-11-13","[Playing every main game part 11.5: Odyssey DLC] Assassin’s Creed Odyssey has two DLC expansions, Legacy of the Hidden Blade and Fate of Atlantis. These two expansions feel worlds apart from each other, and neither is perfect, but both manage to succeed in carrying forth some of the best aspects of the base game.

#Legacy of the First Blade
This DLC centers around Kassandra’s alliance with Darius, wielder of the first hidden blade, and their conflict with the Order of the Ancients. The gameplay isn’t anything special, but the story benefits from its smaller cast and bold narrative decisions.

Legacy does little to change up the gameplay, taking place on the base game’s map and introducing no major mechanics. Notably, the regions used for the DLC were the most content-dry of the base game, which kinda makes Ubisoft look lazy. The only new thing Legacy introduces is the Chimaera’s Breath upgrade for the ship, a front-facing flamethrower. I thought it was cool conceptually, but it didn’t seem to be very effective when I used it. I might’ve been using it wrong, because one random time I nearly instantly destroyed a ship with it, but I never got that to happen again. It’s also a huge missed opportunity that Kassandra doesn’t get to wield a hidden blade in this DLC, especially when that was one of the most glaring omissions from the base game.

Since there’s little done with the gameplay, Legacy’s emphasis is really on its story, and I think it’s a pretty good one. It’s divided into three episodes, but each one is a reasonable size so the DLC doesn’t feel overwhelmingly long.

##**Episode 1: Hunted**
 The first episode opens almost immediately into the action, as Kassandra comes to the rescue of a small village from Persian invaders and meets Natakas. Shortly after, she is ambushed by Darius with the first hidden blade, in a fight that establishes he’s not some old man but rather a total badass. Eventually, Natakas shows up and tells Darius who Kassandra is, and everyone stands down. Darius reveals he is the man who assassinated Xerxes and that the raiders of the village are the Order of Ancients, the proto-Templars first seen in Origins. They’re hunting down “Tainted Ones”, meaning human-Isu hybrids, meaning Kassandra. We get our new target list for the episode– the Order of Hunters– and Kassandra gets to work bringing them down. Strangely, I managed to kill one of these guys before I even started the DLC; I just happened to encounter him while completing locations in the base game. I’m not sure why Ubisoft would let that be possible.

In the meantime, Kassandra begins bonding with Natakas. We learn they have a lot in common, as Natakas has also spent most of his life without a true home, fighting and traveling from place to place due to Darius’ history with the Order. From what I’ve seen this is a hot take, but I liked Kassandra and Natakas together immediately. Sure, Natakas is a bit of a dork and he never gets the chance to prove his ability like Darius does, but he and Kassandra immediately connect in a way that almost no other romance option in the game does (Roxana being the only exception that comes to mind). It’s crazy how romance in Odyssey actually becomes good when the writers don’t have to leave room for the player to pivot away from it at any point or have it be ultimately inconsequential. However, I can see how players who played their Eagle Bearer with a certain orientation or faithfulness to one romance could have their experience hurt by this story. You really can’t have this both ways, Ubisoft.

The next few quests are just about killing the different targets amongst the Order. I appreciate the lack of filler as each quest involves you directly dealing with a target. The quest with the Huntsman and the bodies hung in the swamp was one of my favorites because it did something that practically no video game does, let alone Assassin’s Creed: makes the player (and the protagonist) consider the amount of death they leave in their wake, and the unseen grief that comes with it. I refused to attack the grieving families, but when Kassandra sat in front of the tree, and I had to choose between “I’m a monster” and “I’m not a monster”, it took me a while to decide. This was just one of several times where the DLC presented heavy, introspective moments for Kassandra, and I loved each one.

Anyways, we go and take out the Huntsman, and it’s revealed that Darius and the Huntsman were both members of a group of individuals conspiring to protect Persia. After Xerxes’ death, Darius wanted to kill his son as well, but the other members disagreed and joined the Order, becoming Darius’ enemies in the process. Afterwards, Darius and Kassandra have a brief chat about their dreams of living a simpler life. He and Natakas head out but the group vows to defeat Amorges, leader of the Order’s efforts in Greece and Darius’ former best friend. Thus ends episode 1. It’s pretty solid. It introduces quite a bit of lore withou","5","post"
"FrekvensYR","2025-05-16","This is the most honest and absolutely 100% spot on review of the game I've seen so far. By some margin. A game i had so much hope for, a setting with the highest potential for an Assassin' Creed game out of any since and including the very first one, ends up the worst in the series. Even worse than Rogue, the runt if the litter for many. 

The lack of any storyline is shockingly sad and unfortunately not at all surprising. A reasonably big map that has no justifiable reason for being that big. Apart from crawling and faster running speed, Naoe has nothing to offer as a standout protagonist. Yasuke combat style in one word can be described as dull. All of this on top of the lifeless voice acting and lipsync (Japanese, Portuguese and English). AC2 which came out in 2009 has better lipsync and voice acting that actually carries emotions. Shadows makes you feel like Why am i playing this instead of I need more of this. 

I mean seriously how is it Ubisoft keeps going backwards everytime with the quality of the games?","5","comment"

"According-Effect3585","2025-05-20","Imho, the elephant in the room is that the AC Shadows (at this point) has near zero of the ISU story arc. We hear a few audios, and Naoe has eagle vision, but the rest of the game is simply historical Japan reenactment, with the main mystery being around the 3 imperial treasures, which we, obviously not even going to see in the game outside of their boxes. Story about Oni is the only non-textbook entry I could remember. The rest - it's just a history book animated with all of these endless details who served who, who betrayed who, who killed who, and who occupied which castle. This is too much focus on details done in an extremely tedious way. Sure, AC Origins was also detail-oriented, but we've got an ISU story and those historic artifacts were 3D viewable with lots and lots of visuals. In the previous games we had humorous characters (like Shaun Hastings) or some other amusing dialogs and plot twists. In this game it's all about daughter revenging here father, morally pristine, sterile, predictable. AC Shadows is an expensive AAA game done wrong. I own and have completed every game in the series (some twice - on Xbox 360 and One), but, alas, if the franchise does not re-discover itself, I think this will be the last AC game I bought...","4","comment"
"-Z0nK-","2025-04-22","It's so funny, especially since games like Odyssey did the exact oposite of that! The mercenary headhunter mechanic encouraged the player to venture more off-road to avoid difficult 1on1 combat in undesired occasions.

But of well, while Odyssey is my all-time favorite, I'm not too harsh on this particular aspect of Shadows. Devs were right to try something new, even though they couldn't shake off the old Ubisoft formula completely. I just don't see why this inconvenience should deter you from exploring? Only the mode of doing so changes, which is more like identify a POI and then try to find a suitable way along the roads to get there. It's different, yes, but is it really a big deal?

Edit: My only issue is that roads and paths are rather difficult to identify on the map, which makes route finding unneccessarily complicated.","4","comment"
"WickedFox1o1","2025-03-31","I'm about 80ish hours in and loving it. I've cleared all but 2 regions and I'm mostly playing as Naoe unless there's a quest that needs or makes more sense for Yasuke. I like the meditation mini games though, but I liked them in Frontiers of Pandora too lol. The story is...eh I guess, it's not bad but it's not great either. It probably would have benefited from being a little more linear because even right now I'm not sure what's going on besides just hunting down targets and I think I'm about halfway through Yasuke's personal quest.","4","comment"
"Hold-My-Sake","2025-03-04","Same for me. Sometimes I can spend hours without progressing the main story or even side quests. I just explore nature, wander through cities, climb wherever I can, look for beautiful spots, stop by a market stall or watch people going about their lives. I feel like I’m going to be even more contemplative than usual with Shadows.

With the changing seasons—watching the cherry blossoms bloom, the rain (I love it when it’s rainy and cloudy in a game), the snow—rediscovering everything each time… I’ve already seen some stunning rice fields at sunset, with insane colours reflecting in the water.","4","comment"

"rabidsalvation","2025-04-02","Holy crap, I may have to leave this sub for a bit. I'm really glad that folks are enjoying Shadows. I love that, I'm so happy that people like it. But these fucking circle jerk posts are so old already. AC hasn't truly innovated since Unity. That was the last game to actually try something new. Syndicate was Unity 1.5, and the RPG games are just following trends in gaming. Shadows is just another RPG game with upgrades. Again, I'm really happy that a lot of people are enjoying it, but all of this has been done before. Shadows is just another huge, beautiful open world game filled with question marks. I really hope AC Hexe plays a lot differently, with a world that feels more alive.

I have my own issues with Shadows that I won't get into, but Far Cry and AC have become CODified, with essentially reskins and contentious 'upgrades' for a long time now. Neither franchise has been exciting to me for almost a decade and that is a fucking travesty. These used to be two of my favorite franchises, and now I just don't play the new releases. I uninstalled Syndicate when I got Shadows, but I think I'm going to reinstall it today and actually be excited to play Assassin's Creed. I'm starting to think that Ubisoft just doesn't make games for me anymore...and that's okay. Plenty of games out there, I need to branch out more and try some new things. I'm going to beat Steelrising and get Lies Of P I think.","4","comment"
"The_Hooded_0ne","2025-09-28","What pisses me off about Shadows is the absolute lack of respect it has for the lore.

[SPOILERS FROM NOW ON]

In past games, even the most absurd monsters had a lore reason to exist, and it was explained in-game directly. Now we have a ghost, magical animals and a yokai without even an attempt to interlock them with the lore, as if the game was just some random fantasy RPG.
They took out everything that makes Assassin's Creed special, and together with poor writing it makes me feel the same as you: nothing. Nothing except disappointment because of the wasted potential.

Claws of Awaji made me lose interest in it completely. Naoe finally meets her mother, that is to say the only reason this DLC could have been interesting, and... and nothing really happens, she just gives us some quests. Not a real confrontation, not even a ""reunion"" with Hanzo. Again: nothing.

Yasuke would be a good candidate as well. 

Normally I'd hate retcons as well, but here? I am glad they completely ignored how he was portrayed in Memories where he ended up being just another plot twist generic bad guy, but here? he's so much three dimensional, nuanced and well-rounded as a character.

"RayKainSanji","2025-05-16","I would say that the plot could be confusing for alot of people because there isnt a cohesive plot.

Theres no reason AC should have the Breath of the Wild approach for the main missions (side missions? Sure!). All it does is make everything disjointed. It works for Zelda because every region has its own story to tell...and its also primarily an Adventure title...unlike AC which is primarily a story based title.

Yasuke's story is the best...but templar plot literally has no build up. The only crumbs we have of this plot is the end of the Sandayu fight and when Duarte's subordinate shows up.

Then, when you fight the Templars, we the players have no reason to care about how bad these people are when Yasuke is killing them...cuz we still dont know why hes killing them...not until you kill the last guy...and then the game just fucking ends.

The final scenes at the Hideout proves that theres so much cut content in order to setup the future dlcs/expansion. Theres literally so much left unanswered/unfinished in the story, that I would be wasting my time writing it all out.

This game's story is incomplete...and if anyone buys this game without the DLCs/updates in the future...they will receive a fractured story that doesn't really have a pay off.

It sucks cuz the gameplay and world design is awesome...but the story just doesn't work unless we get everything we'll be getting in the next few years.","3","comment"

"reallybadjazz","2025-02-07","It'd be pretty cool to have most of the game use local dialects to illustrate translation struggles for those aiming for Japanese instead of English dubbing, which would lend to the Portuguese feeling foreign instead of everyone speaking English, or oddly enough, just Japanese.

I am pretty sure most AC games do this with local NPC's in the background, but never completely for storytelling dialogue. 

Honestly, with the way historical tours became implemented, especially with the mythos trillogy, Ubisoft should incorporate a ""Rosetta Stone/Bumble"" type of linguistics course(s) in each game, that way, like in Mirage and now Shadows in which Arabic and Japanese will be centric and accessible, that all the previous games would implement surface level courses to educate based on the countries used in each game, much more thoroughly, but not severely advanced. 

Merely elementary, yet fundamental, introductions to differences between Greek islands or Egyptian divisions would be neat, and to accompany the main game or the tours would be fun. I'd love to rewatch/replay those stories if they were set in their mainland's language(s). Hell, if it were DLC that needed to be litely paid for, I absolutely would.","3","comment"
"DisorganisedPigeon","2025-04-15","Loved the gameplay, world design, characters and music. It was a good stealth game but I felt like it lacked the sci fi element that makes it AC. No references to isu? Pieces of eden? I’m fine not having modern day segments but it lacked that mystery (you could argue that the isu never reached that part of the world or neither did the PoE). Felt the story fell short towards the end, especially the ending. I thought it was good and enjoyed most moments, but I think it stays behind Origins and Odyssey for me. Playing as the assassin I feel Shadows does it best followed by Mirage in the last few games. Ubisoft absolutely kill it with their world design and atmosphere, Shadows is no different and I can’t wait to explore their next AC world","3","comment"
"BoysenberryWise62","2025-07-19","Ubisoft right now have a branding problem which comes from the fact they released many many similar-ish games that landed around 7/10, they had huge misses with Skull and Bones and most of their big critical success are not the AAA people know (PoP Lost Crown for example).

So they basically start with a negative feeling, when they reveal a game the reaction is always ""sounds cool but it's Ubisoft"" and this stigma follows them until release people go on their game with a negative mindset and I think they easily lose 0.5 to 1 point out of 10 in metacritic because of it. Also a problem with youtubers who don't want to lose their audience and are more hesitant to praise thing, and instead talk shit to please the crowds.

We might see it in action this year too, Yotei is going to release and I bet that even if it ends up being same quality as Shadows it will be mentioned in game of the year lists.","3","comment"

I say this as a hardcore classic fan who haven’t enjoyed most of the RPG games except origins. It’s a shame because shadows does so much right but fumbles in so many other ways. It had all the ingredients for a strong 9/10 game and I feel like we got a 7.5/10.

"canonbite","2025-04-06","I'm enjoying the gameplay when I'm in castles, etc, but I find the open world really disappointing.

The map is also a negative for me. No matter where ive explored so far, there aren't any noticeable or interesting landmarks. It's just identical mountains and forests and villages that have no discernable differences. Compare that to Odyssey, or Origins, and there's just nothing noteworthy about the open world.

I love an open world, but for the main story I like consistency. I have no idea if I am killing the targets in order, if i have something left from Naoe story, If I watched Yasuke's in the correct order and place. I honestly hated that open system!","3","comment"

"voidox","2025-11-25","amazing how the ubisoft shills just blindly eat up PR lines and clickbait headlines to keep on with the ""duh Shadows was a massive success!"" narrative, if they would actually try reading the article: 

> Ubisoft said its Assassin’s Creed franchise, including March’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows was “over-performing,” and “generated 211 million session days, ~35% higher than the last two years’ average.” The company did not provide specific sales figures for Shadows. 

it's just PR talk about the entire AC franchise and not giving any specifics on Shadows is very telling: if Shadows was as successful and popular as it's fanboys keep claiming, Ubisoft would have given more specifics on the game. Simple as that. 

also a game can overperform sales expectations, doesn't mean anything cause said sales expectations could be low, so overperforming low expectations isn't really ""massive success"" or w.e. 

just some reality, facts and data for the ubisoft shills and defenders going crazy over this PR fluff.","3","comment"

"GrilledCyan","2025-04-25","Small counter argument, but Skyrim is a very classic RPG where the main character is a self insert. You’re allowed to make them however you want, with whatever skills and background you choose. Not to mention, there are numerous stories you can play in Skyrim. You can “finish” the game without touching the arcs designed for thieves or mages. 

Since Naoe and Yasuke are existing characters I think it’s hard to argue they shouldn’t have growth in their arcs.","3","comment"

I played Alan Wake 2 recently and it literally has an ""infinite health, ammo, flashlight"" option. If you try it, the game will say it's not recommended, but the devs went out of their way to implement it because they want players to have the choice, yet AC Shadows insist on refusing to give us something as simple as a time of day option(I get why but i want the choice).","3","comment"
"Vicentesteb","2025-04-15",">The thing with social stealth is that it works if the settings are densely populated, and unlike before, Japan doesn't have hooded monks where Naoe can blend in.

This is purely about how Ubi has designed its cities though. Acre is significantly smaller and less populated than Kyoto for example, but it doesn't feel that way because of the crowd and building density. Even if you want to discuss games without the monks, AC II also makes their cities feel crowded while being smaller than Kyoto as well.

This has been a huge issue in the franchise lately. Hell in Origins, Alexandria has a population of 500k, significantly larger than basically any city we've ever played in besides London and Paris, but it doesnt feel like that.","3","comment"

"Alamoa20","2025-04-16","I can understand the concept, it's narrative contextualizing and even it's justification, I just don't agree with it. I think it unnecessarily murks the waters for no reason other than to shoehorn a genre transition. The way I look at it is, if an expansion of a concept is done to evolve a gameplay pillar or mechanic that serves the game, its established rules and enhances its loop, then I'm all for it. In Red Dead II, for example, why can we pet the horse, clean it, and bond with it? Because that serves the world, its rules and its established fantasy. It's an evolution, an improvement. Dialogue choices in Assassins Creed are not an improvement, they're a genre transition.

The examples i've used about the horse and bandits are just two among many. You're right, taken by themselves, they feel like a drop in a bucket, but once it trickles and accumulates, you can feel it. Not to a degree that makes me enjoy the game less, like I said, I am enjoying the game a lot. But it's enough to make me feel the dissonance. Take the meditation, for example. In Ghost of Tsushima, once you finish writing the Haikus or reach the top of a shrine, you get a shot of the beautiful scenery....and it stays there till you decide to move the controller. It's a game that is absolutely in awe of its setting and it forces players to feel that same awe by lingering a bit longer, letting you take it all in. In contrast, the meditations in Shadows have a cool filter that melts beautifully around Naoe's environment. You don't have the time to properly see it because you're engaged in the quick time event. And as soon as she finishes, she INSTANTLY gets up and the shot goes back right to the gameplay camera. Imagine if after you finish, the camera stays on that final shot of the environment, as the filter fades back to normal and it only goes back to gameplay once you press a button or move the sticks.

That's what I mean. The difference between a game that absolutely knows what it wants to be and one that also knows what it wants to be, but falters here and there for the sake of engagement.","2","comment"
"Kimkonger","2025-04-25","I agree with EVERYTHING!!! 

My only criticisms with Shadows are,

The very blatant dead and un-interactive open world. It literally feels like content was cut during the delay and what makes it even more apparent is how the dead world is contrasted by how gorgeous and dynamic it looks and feels! Like the more it takes my breath away the more I get frustrated that I can’t reach out and touch it, I’m only allowed to look. It’s such a blue ball for me as I wish I was grounded in the world of Feudal Japan where I feel like exist in it and just on it. There’s also a general lack of stuff happening in major towns and villages, which I had assumed that maybe the open world is dead because they focused on building very lively/interactive towns and villages. Nope, these are just as dead with the exception of castles and a few copy pasted static vendors. That’s about it. There's really no reason to not fast travel everywhere once you are done ogling at the world and unlocking multiple viewpoints/kakuregas. I even expected at least the Kakuregas to be way more interactive with scouts in them and being able to rest and do some minor crafting and gear management. Again, all the interactivity with your player and world is done from a static menu or in the background. Even the somewhat interesting side quest narratives is relegated mostly to dialogue exposition and info you read on a letter. You never really see the effect of any organization dynamically in the open world, yet they are claimed to be very influential positively or negatively. 

Next is the difficulty. As much as the stealth and combat are the best and VERY dynamic, I still feel enemy AI needs to be cranked up so that all new dynamism for combat and stealth is very apparent and insists on being accounted for. 
Even on expert with barely any HUD, I find I have to drastically nerf myself by avoiding some abilities or never fully upgrading others. 

The issue I found after multiple tests is the new and rather cool dynamics just end up as gimmicks that you don’t really have to use. You never really have to crouch slower in winter because it generates more noise or feel the freedom of movement during a rain/snow storm which muffles sound and limits visibility. There’s shadows but you don’t really need to use them, even going prone Or using the underground hatches to infiltrate. The reason is because enemies have slow reaction speeds and don’t hear shit anyway. This is why despite these features being present, you don’t feel the need to use them if not for the vibes. A new difficulty where all the stealth mechanics require mastery and precision is needed. 

For combat it’s kind of the same thing. There's much the enemy and you can do. A lot of enemy dynamism and so much combo potential for the player. Again it’s pointless to use these tech combos because for all their dynamism, enemies are slow/over telegraphed with very long recovery frames after anything they do, they are generally not that aggressive and they have ridiculously generous perfect parry windows. All these things make it so their dynamism is kinda pointless, you can always just get away with spamming and healing when you get hit. Throw in an easy parry here and there and you are good. If you make a simple build and unlock the parry/counter unblockables perks, you essentially break combat! The combat pace is slow and the rhythm is off. Again I hope a new difficulty addressed these. 

If UBI can address these 3 issues, the game will be a solid 9/10. So far it’s a 7 for me.","2","comment"
"The_Green_Filter","2025-07-19","I think the best way to do it is to have a Naoe / Yasuke quest open after every major assassination which deepens their bond a bit.

"-safer-","2025-04-08","My 2 cents, it's a good game but I hate the dual protagonist system enough that I'll probably never beat it. You have to swap between Yasuke and Naoe for their stupid minigames that bore me to tears and some quests need Yasuke or Naoe, so you're forced to change your playstyle to suit the one needed for the mission.

Once I had to swap between Naoe, Yasuke, then Naoe, and then back to Yasuke to complete five minigames in a zone -- I was checked out. The few seconds load screens, forced to gear two characters, the insufferably long time it took to empty my inventory because they don't let  you just mark stuff for dismantle/sell. I think they fixed that with the last patch though.

"Cosmic_Germ","2025-04-15","I'm with you both on this, I've also gotten a fair chunk into the game, and while I've been utterly enamored with many aspects, it sometimes falls short in areas that you mentioned as well as perhaps in how the story is driven/motivated with all the open world freedom and non-linearity in which certain elements and questlines can present themselves. I tend to get carried away for hours infiltrating castles and strongholds, absolutely loving the implementation of stealth systems and the rp experience of being a Shinobi assassin. Then I realize how much time has passed without actually advancing the story and it starts to feel disconnected, like I wish there were more urgency and direction at times. I do feel like that's a common gripe with a lot of open world rpg games, so I don't think it should all fall on Shadows. 

I do, however, resonate with that dichotomy of the AAA product vs the game as art. Assassins Creed in particular has long felt like a tug of war between being its own distinct thing, and being a Ubisoft game.


I think back to the days of the first Prince of Persia series they did, early Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good and Evil, etc, and they were definitely a studio/publisher that were synonymous with balancing artistic creativity and bold visions with strong production values.
As these corporate entities grow in size and value, bottom lines and market interests always seem to take more precedence. 

I will still give AC a lot of credut for clearly still having a lot of love and care put into its art, concepts and themes, under the burden of being a blockbuster.","2","comment"
"a_b1ue_streak","2025-04-15","You make a lot of good points here. I've wanted an AC game in this setting and time period since the series began. I was more than a little disappointed to hear it was going to be another bloated RPG game with all the mechanics I've come to genuinely despise. But then something unlikely happened. I found myself enjoying the gameplay loop so much that I sort of forgot about the gear and leveling and what knot. I was a good thirty hours in before I even reached the end of Act 1.

 And then I found myself enjoying Yasuke as well. You'd think with how much people seemed to love Valhalla, they'd be less butthurt about having a non-assassin main character. Eivor, Kassandra, Shay, and even the Great Edward Kenway weren't assassins for the vast majority of their games, and that's if they became members of the order at all.

 But all that aside, I've been having a blast with the game, and I'm glad you have too. If I were to offer one critique, it would be that the story lacks impact. Once you get into the game proper, there's no sense of urgency to Naoe's story at all. To be fair, that's probably a side effect of the RPG style gameplay. But I'd kill for a story as memorable as Black Flag or AC 3's. 

Of course all this is from someone who, like yourself, has yet to finish the main game. For all I know, there could be some crazy twist that brings the whole thing around for me. Either way, imma keep stabbing dudes.","2","comment"

"starkgaryens","2025-02-23","Since a lot of people are concerned with my comment history, let me provide some context. All of my Reddit time is consumed by this topic, but believe it or not, I have a life outside of Reddit. My passion for this topic started out pretty casual, but I slowly got the feeling that the issue was actively being silenced.

From the beginning, I was met with hate whenever I brought up the history of Asian male marginalization in western media (which is real, look it up). The main Assassin's Creed sub removed a post explaining my case, and I was eventually permanently banned with a mod there misquoting and mischaracterizing my words as racist.

I was temporarily banned from the AC Shadows sub until long after the game comes out because people there were reporting me for harassment. A mod told me that they didn't think I was harassing anyone, but they were just tired of the non-stop reports everyday.

I thought having a formal debate in one place would be more efficient than responding to individual comments and better at bringing light to the issue, so I created a post prompting the debate. It was rejected by almost every sub. When questioned why, the mods cited sub rules that didn't exist and ghosted me. The Ubisoft sub even created a rule retroactively to block the post.

My post here needed to be reworded to remove any semblance of a formal debate, because apparently debates aren't allowed here. It was also removed by an auto-mod that automatically deactivates posts after receiving a certain number of complaints, but a human mod was kind enough to re-approve the post.

TLDR: I'm passionate about discrimination against my community and have become more passionate as it became clear that the issue of Asian male discrimination was actively being silenced or sidelined. If your only argument against my points is the length of my comment history, I think my arguments still stand as valid. Your casual dismissal only proves that Asian discrimination isn't taken seriously, and I think the marginalization of Asians in western media plays a part in reinforcing and perpetuating that.","2","comment"

Shadows so far is great! A large amount of my issues with the other recent games seem to be dealt with, and guided mode helps it feel less padded.

The main characters had a lot of flavor.  I liked the combat system compared to the old version (I played those too, don’t worry).  I may be an outlier, a AC fan since the beginning who actually likes their newer offerings (I admit though I didn’t play Valhalla; it didn’t really tickle my fancy).

Looking forward to playing Shadows and hope they at least keep the narrative elements.  I don’t really like the open world part of games, but if it has good stories I’ll run through those and ignore a lot of the little random things and have a good time.","2","comment"

"Darth_Vaper86","2025-08-06","As a hardcore Assassin’s Creed fan, I’ve been eagerly awaiting this instalment since I heard about it after the announcement of Mirage. During that time, I openly expressed my dissatisfaction with Valhalla, feeling it lacked the core elements of a true AC experience and had a weak story. It honestly felt more like a Viking simulator than a proper AC game.

I got *Shadows* on launch day, excited to dive in. The graphics were decent, but the gameplay? An absolute blast; it’s a noticeable upgrade. However, the story? It felt like I was stuck in an endless loop. The missions just kept repeating: infiltrate, kill, infiltrate, assassinate; over and over. And while the improved stealth mechanics kept me going for a while, I never felt invested in the characters or the narrative.

Looking back, I’d honestly say I prefer Valhalla at this point. While the story in Valhalla wasn’t perfect, at least it offered more variety with engaging quests and events. Shadows just didn’t hit the mark, especially considering it was a AAA game. To be fair, Mirage did a better job with its story, and the characters there were much stronger, although it lasted for 11-12hrs only. 

This is just my personal opinion, but as a long-time fan of the series, I really hope Ubisoft steps it up with the next game (*Hexe*). There’s potential, but I think they need to crank it up a notch to get back to the magic we know and love.","2","comment"
"Quixkster","2025-06-25","Yeah I’m also getting that feeling. Though I did actually like Shadows a lot when it wasn’t forcing me to play as Yasuke. I don’t mind the character in cutscenes but he doesn’t play anything like an assassin.","2","comment"

However, combat was crazy fun to me also. Almost all as Naoe. Playing with her is the way to go - level up, learn how to move right, level up weapons some and it is a ton of fun. 

I don't believe any of the hate is warranted. This game is something special. Truly. And this is coming from someone who had all but lost faith in gaming.","2","comment"
"DonkeyKongChestThump","2025-06-01","“Is it fun?“

Shadows features a very much non-linear narrative that VERY freely allows the player to proceed through its content at his/her own preferred pace. You can rush through the main story missions in 30 hours, or you can take a very relaxed, deliberate bespoke circuitous path, covering 100+ hours. It’s a design and sandbox that (in my opinion) mostly lets YOU decide how (and if) you want to have fun interacting with its gameplay options. I will say that if a gamer strongly prefers a strictly linear narrative, and/or doesn’t enjoy extra freedom/agency in games, then Shadows probably won’t be a good fit for that gamer.

”Is it dull?”

This is difficult to answer, because greatly varying opinions on this could all be completely valid. It depends on the individual gamer. Do you like being guided along a plot-line and want lots of high-octane intensity and drama in your preferred games? Then you probably will find Shadows to be dull. Do you like exploration for the sake of exploration (not rewards) and often feel like a gaming experience should be about the journey, not the destination? Then I think you’ll find Shadows to be engaging and not dull.

”Is the world fun to explore?”

If you get the majority of your satisfaction (during exploration) from discovering unexpected secrets or hidden things, then you will probably be disappointed by Shadows. If you instead get satisfaction from relaxing, taking in the scenery, and/or doing photo-mode stuff when exploring, then you will enjoy Shadows.

”Is the combat good?”

Yes, the combat is programmed well, and feels weighty, fair, and engaging. Shadows has enough weapon and build-crafting variety to prevent combat scenarios from getting stale. Enemy variety is okay. If you’re a seasoned modern ARPG player, difficulty in combat is pretty relaxed (even on the current highest difficulty setting). If you’re a less experienced ARPG player, Shadows‘ combat should be easy to adopt, especially on normal difficulty; combat is not a significant barrier to entry. However, there are some combat elements requiring moderate skill for timing and execution of button inputs. The combat systems will definitely reward a novice who gradually improves toward moderate skill.

"joeshabadoo72","2025-05-21","It's been a long time since I played Mirage but I can't remember loathing the controls in general for any AC game the way I loathe Shadows. Naoe will often fail to go into crouch when I hit the button, so I hit it again and she goes prone. Then doesn't want to get back up. Finally leaps back fully upright and gets me detected.

Or I'm constantly getting stuck on the wrong thing - getting stuck on a roof ledge, jumping onto a flagpole instead of leaping down to the ground or whatever. It's just...terrible. Or trying to make my way up to a sync point only to find that I can't actually climb this specific section of cliff and keep flipping off backwards and sliding down.

The game is undeniably beautiful and I like Naoe as a protagonist better than most but I cannot stand the parkour and movement in general.","2","comment"

AC Shadows definitely surprised me.  The technical aspects of it running some good raytracing and well is something I just didn’t see coming.  I’ve had to deal with crashes, but I blame that more on my laptop than the game.  When it’s running, it’s smooth.  Makes me interested to see this game running on better hardware into the future and the progress they’ll make on the engine.  They make an iteration like this again for their PS6 era titles and they’ll be doing insane stuff.

Gameplay wise, it’s brought back the feeling of being an assassin in AC.  I missed that a lot.  For the people that just want to WOOP ass, they brought that too.

There are so many different characters and flashbacks and names that I just feel like I have no idea what's going on. It's too bad, there's some cool stuff in here but I think the story just needs a bit more focus, a more tight and cohesive narrative would've have made it better. I like taking out the targets and I think the idea with all the masked guys is pretty cool. I'm a big fan of that kind of thing, especially in AC games but yeah I'm feeling a little disappointed with the story right now. I also think I like Naoe's stuff more than Yasuke's just because I'm more into the actual assassin gameplay and underdog vibe. Not really a fan of how much Yasuke talks about how much better things were under Nobunaga, I'm like, bro he still killed a ton of people just for power like what are you on about? Idk maybe I'm missing something. I think I'm gonna just try to focus on the main plot and skip all the side stuff for now. Maybe that'll make it feel better.","1","comment"
"DonkeyKongChestThump","2025-07-31","This OP is way out of bounds. The melee combat in Shadows is really good. I would not go so far as to say it’s superb or excellent, but it’s definitely good.   
There is really nothing about Shadows’ combat that is “trying to mimic Dark Souls” … unless you’re considering the presence of bladed weapons and a Parry input button to now be proprietary or exclusive to Dark Souls. 😆

The teleporting Oni boss from the Dead By Daylight special event is definitely annoying and potentially frustrating. It’s not a well-designed encounter; I’ll agree on that front. However, that’s just one specific fight. If you’re struggling with the Oni, just ditch that quest, for now, and come back to it later, after gaining more buffs and abilities for Yasuke during your play-through.","1","comment"
"fusion_beaver","2025-01-10","Apparently an unpopular opinion, but I hope they've got a win in them. Cause they're playing like they NEED a win. They can't afford to launch with a broken game and fix it later. It has to work Day One this time.  
I've enjoyed all of the modern AC games. They're never masterpieces, but they are fun- and usually really compelling pieces of historical fantasy. The biggest problem these games have suffered from is bloat. They've confused AAAA for ""Massive, -larger than anyone else tries to build- open world"". But Mirage was a much more paired-down experience and was a better game because of it.   
Everything I've seen of Shadows sounds interesting. Yasuke seems like a neat piece of Japanese history to play with, and a fun way of splitting the class problem: ""Which do you want to play as: Samurai, or Ninja?""  
Ubisoft have been run by an absolutely buffonish C-Suite, who seem to thing they discovered the perfect game design formula in 2012.... But I still remain hopeful for AC: Shadows- cause I like AC, I like Far Cry, and I want them to get better.","1","comment"

"NotD3AD_Z3R0","2025-10-22","Idk why everyone is saying it doesn’t play like a Soulslike, it literally does 😭 I just ran into the Oni today, and his attacks are just choreographed into nonsense. He will wind up overheads, teleport, then slam the red stuff on the ground in often impossible attacks that will catch you on your recovery if you’re dodging and are outright unblockable without engravings/skills. He even has mix-up attacks where he changes the speed in which he spins the parryable kanabo. Literally no other game plays like this, except Shadows, and it’s really glaring, and really bad for this specific enemy.

At its core, you see the foundations of what makes a Soulslike:

•R1/R2 attack scheme
• Most soulslikes (like Rise of the Ronin, Nioh, Wo Long, Black Myth, etc.) have ability wheels (or specific button commands) to preform mid combo to add variety to the R1/R2 scheme
• Posture system
• “Reactive” gameplay (as in you are supposed to learn and react to specific attack patterns and quirks granted by certain enemies/bosses
• Bleed literally does the same effect as Elden Ring (which is, massive damage when the status effect fills, a deviation from its common function of reducing health in ticks)

To those who argue “but you see these in every game” that’s kinda what OP’s point is. You simply can’t tell me many action/adventure or RPG titles that don’t include Soulslike systems in their games, which is fine, it’s a clearly successful model that can be innovated, like any game. But the issue is that Shadows does nothing to make their game feel any different than a typical Soulslike.

This isn’t to say I’m some major hater of the game, I still like it for what it is, Naoe’s stealth mechanics have my heart and Yasuke barreling through a castle and cutting down droves of samurai feels hype, but the Oni is a very lazy boss that highlights the lowlights of the combat system when faced with poorly choreographed and often unfair attacks.","1","comment"
"DJ-RayRicoDaddySlicc","2025-05-25","My only issue with Shadows is the story. It felt so underwhelming and poorly written. Naoe feels like she barely has a personality compared to Yasuke. You’re once again not playing as an actual member of the Assassins, imagine not playing as a member of the organization the franchise is named after. This whole time, we chase after some box and we never even see what’s in it. Is it a piece of eden? No one knows. While I like that the Templars return, Naoe doesn’t even hear about them despite them being behind the Shinbakufu’s fuckery. And the story ends on a cliffhanger where Naoe is on the verge of finding her mother, don’t even know if it’ll continue onwards. And don’t even get me started on the Modern Day; it’s DOGSHIT","1","comment"
"DonkeyKongChestThump","2025-07-31","I disagree with this comment, partially. There are definitely times when it’s advantageous and preferable to deactivate lock-on combat camera. If you want to reposition strategically mid-combat, definitely temporarily deactivate lock-on. If you want to specifically focus down one particular foe when engaged by multiple hostiles, then yes, deactivate lock-on so you can more efficiently move your character into range of that particular enemy.

However, it’s also advantageous, at other times, to keep the lock-on camera active. In fact, I would suggest that recognizing when to use lock-on (and when not to use it) is an important part of a player’s dexterity/skill progression while playing Shadows. I would not recommend that a player uses lock-on 100% of the time. I would also not recommend using lock-on 0% of the time.   


It’s best to experiment with toggling the lock-on feature, organically, so that each individual player can experience and learn which situations are (and aren’t) appropriate for lock-on within that player’s style.","1","comment"

"PontusFrykter","2025-10-13","I loved Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla because of the varied exploration and freedom in doing it. Shadows is absolutely horrendous in this. They should've just took Valhalla as the base, make the game 1.5-2x smaller and make activities more varied (and there were A LOT of variety in Valhalla).

Instead, they made the majority of map non-explorable due to mountain hikes, the activity variety seems like 3x less than in Valhalla. I was bored as fuck.

And the story hasn't immersed me at all. I was locked in during Ghost of Tsushima due to how urgent and important the plot seemed. The consequences of war and little stories of people during it really made me attached to the mission till the end.

Here, I just dropped it after 30 hours. Yeah, foxes in GoT were fucking boring, but everything else I really enjoyed. In AC: Shadows seemed that everything except the environment design was made without the love of art. Everything seems so artificial in that game.

P.S. Even praised stealth and parkour, I feel that they TRIED, but that systems are so clunky, robotic and unresponsive. And the combat, I just straight up hated it. In valhalla somehow the 20hitstokill formula worked for me, but here I just sticked with stealth (yeah, which is only playable after you enable ""one hit kill stealth mode"", unless you want to spend 1.5 hours on every base or minmaxing your legendary builds.","1","comment"
"curtisbingham123","2025-07-28","I enjoyed it. Granted I don’t think I’ve ever played open world with yasuke and only used him when needed in missions, I do like the way the missions are catered towards him and it’s a nice change of gameplay for a little bit. Open world is 100% Naoe no matter the situation. And any mission where there’s a choice, it’s Naoe. One thing I was quite disappointed in was the fact there was nothing that referenced the Isu. Yes I think some games take it too far with all of the mythical weapons but I do enjoy the modern day sections and the lore that comes with the isu. This game did feel like it was an ‘assassins creed’ in terms of stealth, gameplay, etc but it just didn’t feel like it was linked to any other game besides a few missions and the concept of the game. Even the first few games, which everyone always compares everything to, still had isu references. 

I still don’t understand why everyone hates on this new combat system. I HATED the whole parry attack, parry attack, parry attack system. Now you’ve got a bit of a challenge with adapting gameplay to which weapon you’re using since they all need different play styles. 

I do enjoy the lighting system. I don’t think I utilise it as much as I could but I also don’t think it’s the best it could be. I was disappointed that you couldn’t skip time and I’m glad they’ve added it. 

I’m also glad they’re listening to what people actually want from the game and adding them","1","comment"

"Vhexer","2025-10-25","It’s good. It takes the “dominate the battlefield with sheer strength” aspect of the last few games and combines it with actual stealth that’s more reminiscent of the older games (by choice of Yasuke or Naoe)

The only thing I don’t like is the pacing. As someone who likes to do every side thing before the main, this game makes it a little more convoluted. 

But combat is fun, lots of different builds and play styles due to Legendary effects (and being able to basically combine 2 legendaries makes for some creative choices) 

Exploration could have more to be desired, I don’t think any AC will beat Odyssey in that. Maybe if I had more knowledge of Japanese culture there would be more things that caught my eye in terms of historical recreations/adaptations of locations","1","comment"
"tisbruce","2025-04-15","> Why am I deciding the fates of people, groups and towns and villages when I'm RELIVING memories?

How can you die/desynchronise if you're just reliving memories of somebody who didn't make that mistake? Why did the OG Animus have a training module, with Lucy or Rebecca guiding Desmond through key skills, if Desmond was just going to watch a movie of an expert doing it? Vidic lied to Desmond (well, gave him a simple description of how the Animus works becaause he thought Desmond was an idiot). I suspect the earliest versions of the Animus really were no more than VR movies - a recording we hear of one of the early subjects suggests that - but by the time Desmond was plugged into one the systemm had become more complex: not simply a replay, not entirely a simulation, but a fusion of both. The computer system running the OG Animus was sophisticated enough to give Desmond *some* scope to deviate from the original memory, but could only cope with so much and either desynchronised him or forced him back to the next narrative gateway that he just had to play out as it originally happened.

Since then, the Animus has been upgraded several times  (as Rebecca and Layla kept telling us), so the scope for variation has increased - but is still limited, hence none of those apparently major plot decisions presented by the Layla-era Animus actually changing much if anything. The illusory choices allow the subject to decide what kind of person the historical protagonist is, but no significant ability to change how they affected the world. Choose the wrong guy to be Ealdorman? Well, OK, you can have a little extra theatre, but the timeline is going to be bent back to end up where it always did. Make the wrong decision about whether to kill or exile somebody? Ah, no, the computer can't find a way to let that happen, so the king is going to ignore you and be a bit disappointed in you; best we could do. That other guy can die, though, even though he didn't really, becausee nobody important ever heard from him again anyway.

As for assassination, I've never wanted guaranteed assassination back, but I agree with pretty much everything (else) you said about it. Valhalla had a smart solution, but Shadows has an even smarter one. How people can say the Shadows system devalues stealth (unless you turn on guaranteed assassination), I don't know. Shadows gives you all the information you need and forces you to think more tactically. It's one of several mechanics in Shadows that show more innovative and coherent thought than Ubisoft have delivered for years.

Which brings me on to your ""at war with itself"" idea. I agree in principle, but I don't buy the whole narrative. I don't think a game that has meditation and katas and crawling on all fours to sketch an animal is demanding constant engagement; the horsse thing is just a badly implemented idea that strikes a wrong note, not a sign of a general policy. Bandits reappearing in the same places every season isn't a policy, it's a shoddy compromise because somebody didn't find enough time and resources to deliver a better solution. On the other hand, the idea that the game doesn't always have the courage of its convictions feels right. I've been surprised by how often this game refuses to compromise or pander, and says ""This is the game we made, so play it"" in a way the bigt 3 RPGs didn't even try, but the resolve clearly wavered at times.","1","comment"

Landscapes and the idea of the *main story is awesome*, but the rest is most fighting, assassinating and trying to get it done.

And if I wanted to feel like a Samurai, I'd go play Ghost of Tshushima, which (in my humble opinion) has much better combat anyways. I wish they'd doubled down on making you feel like an awesome Shinobi and refined some of those mechanics (particularly the parkour). Also, I know it's a common complaint, but can we stop with the whole ""they're too high a level for you to fully assassinate?""

"Reasonable_End704","2025-02-20","[The new Assassin's Creed game ""Yasuke"" sparks controversy over footage depicting the destruction of a shrine's interior. The real-life shrine states it will take ""appropriate action.""] The following content was reported by a Japanese newspaper.

The upcoming release of Ubisoft's game *Assassin’s Creed Shadows*, set in Japan’s Sengoku period and featuring Yasuke, a Black samurai who served Oda Nobunaga, is now one month away from its scheduled launch on March 20. Concerns have been raised about historically inaccurate depictions being spread overseas, such as Yasuke being portrayed as a formidable samurai. Additionally, a new controversy has emerged regarding the use of real-life temples and shrines in the game without permission. In particular, a video showing Yasuke entering a shrine and destroying altars and other sacred objects was published on video-sharing platforms, leading to backlash on social media. A representative of the shrine told *The Sankei Shimbun*, ""We will take appropriate measures.""

**""We Would Have Rejected It If They Had Consulted Us""**

When asked whether Ubisoft had contacted them for permission, the shrine’s representative stated, “No, they did not. If they had, we would have refused.” The representative also expressed displeasure but declined to comment on the details of the ""appropriate measures"" they plan to take, though they may be requesting the shrine’s removal from the game. Meanwhile, the Association of Shinto Shrines, which was rumored to be taking action, denied any involvement.

The primary criticism here is that a *real-life* shrine was allegedly used *without permission*. In response to inquiries from *The Sankei Shimbun* on the evening of February 18, Ubisoft’s Japan branch had not provided a response as of noon on February 20.

edit:

There are three key points regarding this issue:

1. **Harima-no-Kuni Soja Itatehyōzu Shrine** (a religious site)
2. **Tōdaiji Temple** (a religious site)
3. **The flag of the modern ""Sekigahara Teppo-tai""**, a group dedicated to preserving the tradition of matchlock guns and promoting Sekigahara.

According to reports, **Ubisoft did not obtain permission to use any of these**.

* **Itatehyōzu Shrine has explicitly stated that they do not approve and will take appropriate measures.**
* **Tōdaiji Temple has commented that discussions are ongoing.**
* **The ""Sekigahara Teppo-tai"" flag issue was resolved by removing it from the game and concept art.**

**Three separate cases of unauthorized use have led to disputes.**

"Sweet_Brilliant_5470","2025-04-07","[Shadows: The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly] I actually hadn't intended to buy Shadows after getting a little burned out on the series from the massive slog that was the last few RPG entries. Then I'd seen some early reviews about the stealth mechanics and it sounded like a step in the right direction, so I purchased it on release and immediately dove in.

Theres a lot to like. And a lot to dislike. After finishing the main campaign, I wanted to try another Assassins Creed game, and so I played Unity for the first time. I'd never played Unity before but it offered a stark contrast to Shadows, and really drove home what worked and what didn't in the new game. Like I said, I'd never played Unity before, so the comparisons below aren't made through the lens of nostalgia.

As always, YMMV. This is just what worked and what didn't for me.

**THE GOOD**

Shadows is an absolutely gorgeous game. There's no denying that. The environment is detailed and colorful, the lighting is amazing, and the game makes me want to travel to Japan in the near future. The seasons was an excellent touch, and each beautiful in its own way.

The stealth was a step-up from the other RPG titles, though I wish they'd incorporated more of the social stealth they'd brought back in Mirage. The light and dark system was a great addition that made me wonder why they'd never included it before. Having Naoe slip through a window, snuff out all the lights, and then creep around was great.

Having bystanders like servants who can alert guards was another fantastic addition, as was being able to go prone and crawl through brush or under houses. Even going prone on the rooftops saved me from being spotted more than a few times.

I love a lot of the gameplay ideas on display here, though I feel many of them aren't fully developed. Exploring the map by talking to characters and eavesdropping on conversations is a great idea. It doesn't quite work like it should in implementation. More on that in ""THE BAD"" below.

The Knowledge Rank system was another great idea. I loved the meditation mini-games for Naoe. The katas for Yasuke were at times very annoying, but I eventually got the hang of it, and it makes sense in the game world how he'd level up this way. The shrines were also a nice addition, though the knowledge scrolls hidden around temples was kind of a bland and uninteresting way to gain points.

I also really liked the series of duels you can do as Yasuke against your teacher's other students. It felt appropriate to the world, to the samurai genre, and was just fun.

While I think the switch between characters wasn't implemented as well as it could have been, I did enjoy that, when I repeatedly got my ass kicked by some boss as Naoe, I could return to them as Yasuke and destroy them. I took a perverse glee in that as a player, but it also made sense for them as characters working together.

The story itself is going to pop up in all three of these in various respects, because its execution is all over the place. But there's a lot to like here. Naoe and Yasuke both start kind of bland and it's hard to get invested in them, but then they slowly develop personalities over the course of the game. Once the Templar element is introduced for Yasuke, I was all in. And after hours of fighting samurai and shinobi, facing off against the Portuguese was a surprise change of pace.

And I know a lot of people hated the idea of a black samurai. Arguments about how historically authentic that is in regards to the real Yasuke aside, it makes for a really compelling story and character. Especially once the Templar backstory is revealed. My own quibble with it is that I don't think they did enough with it. While he was often referred to as an outsider, most characters just treated him as a samurai like any other. Not having some more conflict there, and more hurdles for him to overcome, was a real missed opportunity.

I didn't mind gatekeeping assassinations of higher level enemies here as much as in previous games. The animation of the guard catching your hand and pushing you away helped this a lot, as it felt more like I got caught and less like I just didn't do enough damage. My caveat to this, however, is that assassinations are still often health based, and there's nothing more immersion breaking and less Assassin's Creed than landing a perfect assassination on an an unsuspecting foe only to do a little damage and still have to fight them. But getting caught trying to kill someone? That works! In fact, I'd even enjoy not getting the red, yellow, etc assassination prompt and having no clue if my assassination is going to get caught or not, then having my chance at killing them increase as I put more points into my assassination skills.

**THE BAD**

Back to exploring the map by eavesdropping and how it didn't quite work. The conversations seem random and I found myself blindly running around a village, back and forth, in hopes of overhearing something useful. If th","0","post"

"Reasonable_End704","2025-03-19","[Assassin's Creed New Release, Addressed in Japanese Parliament, Cultural Risks Remain Unresolved at Launch] There was a Japanese parliamentary inquiry regarding the new Assassin's Creed game. This is a summary of the article compiled by Japanese media, and its contents have been summarized and translated into English.

Ubisoft's *Assassin's Creed Shadows*, set in Sengoku-era Japan and featuring the character Yasuke, a black man who served under Oda Nobunaga, was raised in Japan's National Diet. The controversy began when gameplay footage showed Yasuke destroying altars at a real-life shrine in the game. This issue was discussed in the Japanese House of Councillors on March 19, where Hiroyuki Kada, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, raised concerns about the unauthorized use of the shrine's likeness. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of respecting cultural and religious values and stated that actions disrespecting these values should not be tolerated.

The shrine involved, the Harima Kokun Shrine in Himeji City, expressed discomfort over the destruction shown in the game. Kada also expressed concerns about the potential real-life mimicking of in-game actions and asked about government stances on the issue. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry's Deputy Minister, Masaki Ogushi, confirmed that commercial use of intellectual property requires permission from the relevant parties. Kada questioned why Japan's culture was treated differently from others in the series, where destruction of foreign sites is not allowed.

*Assassin's Creed Shadows*, which has over 200 million copies sold globally, has stirred fears about misrepresenting Japanese history, particularly Yasuke's portrayal as a ""legendary samurai."" The game, which had been delayed twice, is now set for release on March 20. This issue could raise further concerns over the portrayal of Japan's culture and intellectual property rights, especially given the potential for real-world consequences if the controversy escalates.

Edit:

It seems that most people who read this post don't fully understand the issue. While there are cultural concerns, the most serious issue is the 'unauthorized commercial use of intellectual property.' In Japan, religious buildings are protected by intellectual property rights. Just because a building is old doesn't mean it's considered part of the public domain. In Japan, UBI is seen as a lawless barbarian for using famous buildings without permission.

"Apathetic_Tuna","2025-05-11","[Alternatives to online gaming worth trying out?] I make this post in regards to online games as of late feeling as though its declining for me personally and was wondering what everyone else's feelings are on the subject?

I've got a huge backlog of story games with brilliant games like Clair Obscur, Oblivion, AC Shadows, all of which I've been playing through and it's where some of the best titles have emerged as of late.

However, my time spent with online gaming has dwindled into nothingness. Outside of Outlast Trials on certain occasions, all of what used to be some of my most played series, don't feel the same. In the past month, I've tried branching out to things like Fortnite, Marvel Rivals, Destiny 2, Overwatch, but none of it feels enjoyable. Cod was of course a staple growing up and a series I've sunk hundreds of hours into but now with bo6? It feels quite stale and I know for certain that the heavy reliance of fomo, microtransactions, etc have affected these games.

What are some alternatives you've all found if you're still bothering with online gaming to this day? Have you found more enjoyment or activity in older titles?","0","post"
"Key_Statistician_378","2025-10-13","[MAYBE HOT-TAKE: I like Shadows better than Yotei.] Hey Reddit,

  
When Ghost of Tsushima released, I loved it. Loved its Art Direction. Loved the Gameplay.

Loved that we finally had a game in Japan with Samurais and Katanas and everything.

Played on Lethal 1st Playthrough and platinumed the theeeng.

  
Couple years later .... AC Shadows releases ... and there was the endless debate about whats the better game.

GoT? Or ACS?

I like ACS for a couple of reasons. Thought they did a great job. Some things were (in typical ubisoft fashion) a little .....sigh-inducing ... other things were very nice ... 

And since they are both kinda different from each other - I wasn't really able to put my finger on what Game I actually liked better.



Fast Forward - Yotei releases. Ive just ended my latest playsession. Playtime is at 16 hours and ...

**I am not really looking forward to play on.** Even now that I finally made my way towards the next main target (The Kitsune) and had the (sort of) introductory cutscene ... I just do not care. The last mission around that mother that rescues a bear pub and her son who ... see? I do not even remember why I did all that but I sure know I was BORED OUT OF MY MIND!

Its familiar und good ... much like GoT and even better in some aspects. World is better. It just seems like a nice evolution from GoT. Having a good swordfight were every parry connects and you rip through your enemies never gets old.

But now that we've got Shadows and a new Comparison seems in order .... I actually like Shadows better.

Can not even describe it, honestly. Shadows just ""feels"" better.  

  
Whats your take?","0","post"

"starkgaryens","2025-02-21","[Ubisoft is perpetuating western media's history of marginalizing Asian men in Assassin's Creed Shadows, here's why I think that] I actually don't think visual inaccuracies in architecture/seasons due to design choices and indirect irreverence toward destructible sacred objects constitute cultural insensitivity due to those things being common in most previous AC games. If it's insensitive, it's insensitive in a manner and scale that's consistent with the rest of the series.

It's the unusual and/or seemingly inexplicable differences from every other game in the series that make it seem like Ubisoft is perpetuating western media's marginalization and discrimination against Asian men (whether they're aware of it or not), particularly East Asian men. (I'm happy that Asian women are being represented with Naoe, but that's irrelevant to my point.)

Here are those differences:

1. Shadows is the first mainline game to star a historical figure as the main protagonist when the premise since the series' beginning has been playing as characters who kept their identities hidden from history.
2. Shadows is the first game where both protagonists aren't capable of blending in with an existing population within the setting. (It's the first game that needed an outsider perspective to be ""our eyes"" in the words of a Ubisoft dev.)
3. The historical inaccuracies involving the lead historical figure in Shadows don't happen behind-the-scenes of history or involve sci-fi / secret-organization explanations like they did in previous games (pope fist fight, Da Vinci contraptions, etc.), they happen in the open without stealth options (entire country of Japan forgetting a conspicuous outsider and minor celebrity roaming the land cutting down locals unstealthily wherever he went).
4. Shadows rewrites fundamental aspects of a historical figure's existing record and who they were beyond the levels of previous AC games (changing their date/manner of death vs changing the fact that they had no freedom of movement/communication).

All of these changes happening all of a sudden in the series' first East Asian setting in a dozen mainline games makes me think it's discrimination, and all of the excuses I've seen from Ubisoft and those that defend them seem to support this and don't adequately justify not including a prominent role for Asian men in a game the exploits their culture when western media has been emasculating, demeaning, and marginalizing Asian men when not outright excluding them for most of it's history.

This is just my opinion based on observation of existing facts.

\-- EDIT:

I've added ""mainline"" to ""game"" and ""main"" to ""protagonist"" due to accusations of lying and being factually wrong. (It was an oversight, not a lie, and regardless, it should've been obvious to anyone who knows anything about the series.)

\-- EDIT 2:

Since a lot of people are concerned with my comment history, let me provide some context. All of my Reddit time is consumed by this topic, but believe it or not, I have a life outside of Reddit. My passion for this topic started out pretty casual, but I slowly got the feeling that the issue was actively being silenced.

From the beginning, I was met with hate whenever I brought up the history of Asian male marginalization in western media (which is real, look it up). The main Assassin's Creed sub removed a post explaining my case, and I was eventually permanently banned with a mod there misquoting and mischaracterizing my words as racist.

I was temporarily banned from the AC Shadows sub until long after the game comes out because people there were reporting me for harassment. A mod told me that they didn't think I was harassing anyone, but they were just tired of the non-stop reports everyday.

I thought having a formal debate in one place would be more efficient than responding to individual comments and better at bringing light to the issue, so I created a post prompting the debate. It was rejected by almost every sub. When questioned why, the mods cited sub rules that didn't exist and ghosted me. The Ubisoft sub even created a rule retroactively to block the post.

My post here needed to be reworded to remove any semblance of a formal debate, because apparently debates aren't allowed here. It was also removed by an auto-mod that automatically deactivates posts after receiving a certain number of complaints, but a human mod was kind enough to re-approve the post.

TLDR: I'm passionate about discrimination against my community and have become more passionate as it became clear that the issue of Asian male discrimination was actively being silenced or sidelined. If your only argument against my points is the length of my comment history, I think my arguments still stand as valid. Your casual dismissal only proves that Asian discrimination isn't taken seriously, and I think the marginalization of Asians in western media plays a part in reinforcing and perpetuating that.","0","post"
"Amoral_Abe","2025-03-20","[Why does Ubisoft get so much hate from the gaming public?] Online it has become very popular to bash Ubisoft and talk about how their games are formulaic and the same game repeated.  However, I feel like most people haven't actually played a lot of their games and assume they're all the same or jump on the bandwagon.  When looking at different genres they get involved in during the last 10 years there are (along with some of the most recognizable games in each category):  

  

1. Open World Single Player (this is what most people point to.  Far Cry, Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs)
2. Isometric City Builder strategy (Anno Series)
3. Parody Games (South Park RPGs)
4. Board Games and Family Games (Monopoly, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, Family Feud)
5. Sports (Trials, Legendary Fishing, Steep)
6. Shooters (Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell)
7. Combat Multiplayer (For Honor) 
8. Racing (The Crew)
9. Other (Star Trek: Bridge Crew VR, Mario + Rabbids)



Ubisoft as a publisher and developer has been criticized of loot boxes or microtransactions in the past, however, most studios do that and Ubisoft's microtransactions are almost never required for an optimal experience.  Also, for those who just look at 1 series being rereleased, Ubisoft is one of the few developers actually willing to overhaul the gameplay.  

  

* Assassin's Creed  
   * This started because Ubisoft was considering remaking Prince of Persia but opted to create a new game series.
   * Phase 1 games:  AC 1, AC 2, AC Brotherhood.
      * These were fairly limited in scope and far more centered around concrete historical events mixed with conspiracy for power and control.  
      * Combat was not great and was discouraged in favor of assassinating target.
      * Stealth mechanics and climbing was basic but this was a new genre and it was well done for the time.
   * Phase 2 games: Black Flag, Syndicate, Unity, AC 3
      * These games were more expansive in scope and really started testing out a wide range of new gameplay styles and features.  
      * Some features were popular and leveraged in other titles (such as ship combat)
      * A lot of the ""Assassin's Creed"" parts were widely criticized as feeling out of date while the newer features were often praised by people.  Black Flag stood out as a fan favorite for capturing the feeling of 18th century Caribbean Pirate gameplay.
   * Phase 3 games: Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, Shadows (not yet released)
      * Phase 3 largely came about because people felt the old formula of AC was dated and were heavily criticizing Ubisoft for keeping it.  Ubisoft shifted towards a more RPG heavy gameplay style with a greater emphasis on combat rather than assassinations.  
      * The combat was widely overhauled and was generally popular with people.
      * The assassination aspect was criticized as having been mitigated in this new system that favored players tackling assassination different ways.
      * Origins and Odyssey are the 2 that are generally loved in this phase as they featured fleshed out open worlds with lots of content, good combat, and sailing mechanics imported from Black Flag.  They were also relatively well balanced which Valhalla was criticized for.

As can be seen by that 1 franchise, Ubisoft made sweeping changes on a regular basis to attempt to keep things fresh and avoid the same formula for too long.  They were always listening to criticism and trying to adapt because of it.  

In addition, Ubisoft often focused on single player games and complete paid games, rather than freemium or pay to win multiplayer games. Their games often contained a very large amount of content for the price and were well flushed out.  This is in stark contrast to other major publishers (such as EA).  

Thus... my question is as follows.

Why does Ubisoft get so much hate from the gaming public?  Am I missing something here?  The amount of hate seems out of proportion.","0","post"
"Slow-Boysenberry3150","2025-12-01","[The recent trend of open-structure narrative needs to die] I want to start this discussion with ‘Ghost of Yotei’. This open narrative with “go anywhere, kill any target in any order” actually does more harm to a gameplay experience than giving the player freedom or whatever they were aiming to do. It almost always sacrifices narrative spine; you lose build-up, foreshadowing, emotional peaks, coordinated reveals and all of that memorable stuff that makes you wanna look back into how amazing the gaming experience was.

Every single dialogue sequence in GoY serves only one purpose: “Atsu hates the Yotei Six”. That’s it. It’s just looping around that one note. Super one-dimensional main character writing for a game with AAA budget and literally a Sony first party studio.

I guess what can they even do here… when you can play any mission in any order. AC Shadows has the exact same problem and it lasts for 30 hours. It is a real shame because I am sure with the Ubisoft hate and this garbage design, many people never got to experience how good the climax of AC Shadows is. You can clearly see how good it gets when Ubisoft does focused set-piece sequences.

That’s TWO major big budget games in the same year with this trend and I pray this trend immediately dies. I really really hope future games do NOT adopt this structure. You can NEVER build a narrative peak with stakes, critical beats, emotional payoffs etc with this.

I am halfway through GoY and I don’t remember anything in the game except the first cutscene where you kill Snake and then take in the vista while riding the horse with the title drop. That’s literally it… only thing that stuck with me. It’s such a shame because Ghost of Tsushima had so many memorable narrative moments outside the jaw dropping visuals.","0","post"
"asdjklghty","2025-07-28","[AC Shadows' Combat Should Be the Nail In the Coffin] I'm late to AC Shadows because I wanted to wait for Ubisoft to optimize performance after a couple patches and the reviews were mixed.

I'm at the begining of Act 2 and I stumbled upon a quest where a Oni appears. I'm mostly playing as Naoe but since this Oni butthole is tough I switched to Yasuke but here's where this boss fight exposes the fundamental flaw of the current AC combat.

The current AC combat wants to mimic Dark Souls combat without an understanding of how it works. It has the appearance with the manual lock-on and the dodges and parries. But there's one element missing: movesets.

This Oni boss is the perfect example of what's missing. How am I supposed to learn its moveset when it's programmed to attack me from outside my view? I've tried not locking on so I can manually turn away from it. But no matter what direction I do I always get hit even after a slow-mo dodge! 

For comparison I know Maliketh's moveset very well. Phase 2 is exciting because his leap attack is dodged with sideways, sideways and forward.

  
AC combat is so bad it can't figure out how to mimic Dark Souls combat so it resorts to cheap difficulty.","0","post"

You have again 2 Protagonists but you will have to Play some parts of the Game with one if you want or not.

For example the Prolog is completely with Yasuke the Samurai who plays more Action Focused without Stealth or Parcour possibilities. After that you play for quiet a while as Naoe, the mostly Stealth and ""Assassin"" focused Protagonist. 

When you then unlock Yasuke sometime down the line you can stick for most of the Game to one but there will still be Missions that force you to play a certain Character/way.","0","comment"

"Alamoa20","2025-04-15","[Assassins Creed Shadows is a game at war with what it wants to be] I dunno how this post will end up by the time I finish typing it. It's not exactly a review, as I haven't finished the game yet, but I've played it for a long enough time to be confident in describing how I feel about it. Let me preface by saying that I've been loving Shadows. I can confidently say it's my favorite out of all the RPG games and even tops some of the older games for me(Unity, Syndicate). It's the first RPG AC that made me feel like I want to experience all the things I loathed about RPG AC. Hidden blade damage, dialogue choices...etc. These mechanics felt like nothing more than a gimmick, a coat of paint to fully transition Assassins Creed into RPG, without thinking about how to properly integrate them into what makes Assassins Creed, you know, Assassins Creed. Dialogue choices in Odyssey amounted to the same blue print of Witcher 3. Moral dilemmas and how to deal with them.

To me, that's not really Assassins Creed. The way I saw it back then was dialogue choices on their own were completely preposterous because of how they were presented. I realized that I didn't have a problem with the mechanic itself, but its function. Why am I deciding the fates of people, groups and towns and villages when I'm RELIVING memories? It doesnt make sense. Valhalla slightly tweaked them so that dialogue choices instead simply paint a demeanor for the protagonist's personality. How they approach a situation, how they react to events happening, words said...etc. But it still felt like a gimmick.  
I'm a huge fan of social stealth and I will never change my mind about how it is just as integral as every other element of the gameplay loop to Assassins Creed. And in a game like Shadows, that lacks Social stealth, dialogue choices provide a SLIVER of that fantasy. It's not a proper mechanic, hell, it's not even THAT prevalent throughout the story nor in side quests, but it happens enough times throughout that it was enough for me to toss canon mode aside. The feeling of disguising yourself, figuring out the right answers to keep up the disguise and lie to others is EXACTLY what Assassins Creed dialogue choices should've looked like like from the very beginning. It should've been used to ENHANCE social stealth, an existing pillar of the franchise, not try to be its own thing.

Next comes Guaranteed Assassinations. Again, another feature that I felt was preposterous to have in Assassins Creed. Stealth, social or otherwise, is a navigational puzzle. If you move right, take the correct paths, avoid the obstacles, and position yourself correctly, you'll be rewarded with a clean, low profile kill. Why should I do ALL of that and STILL fail to register a clean kill, because my ""hidden blade damage is not high enough""? Also again, Valhalla kind of fixed that by eliminating damage entirely and adding a quick time event instead. It was clunky; however, and severely impacted the flow and pace of gameplay, so I opted for guaranteed Assassination instead. Shadows on the other hand, does away with damage entirely and instead opts to use health segments, which let me tell you, is suuuuuch a better way of streamlining hidden blade upgrades for RPG AC. It's not grindy, it's not clunky, but it still felt out of place for me, so I WAS going to opt for Guaranteed Assassinations again. Except this time, I discover that Shadows bring back a looong forgotten feature of the hidden blade from AC I: Contextual Denied Assassinations with guards on high alert or expert archetypes. Guaranteed Assassinations turn those off and I could not do that because it makes so much sense for that to happen, it was perfect and I was willing to bite the bullet and deal with the new hidden blade damage upgrades JUST so I can have this feature. Like I said, stealth is a navigational puzzle. Positioning yourself is super important for me.

So far so good. But why is it at war with itself? Because we only have those features and those tweaks because you can turn them off. Let me explain:

This game only goes all the way down a mechanical pipeline when it can be turned off. We have the deepest regular stealth system in Assassins Creed ever, that utilizes light, shadow, noise and certain environmental and seasonal elements. But you can turn ALL of that off by adjusting the difficulty.  
We have a dialogue system that can sometimes feel like a social puzzle to solve, but you can turn it off with canon mode.  
On the other hand, you have a guard social interaction that feels developed enough that it actually SLIGHTLY resembles Red Dead Redemption II's wanted system interactions with the law. But it doesn't go all the way. It's not deep enough to impact enough gameplay moments.

In other words, this game is TERRIFIED of not constantly engaging the player. It's a game that DEMANDS you to slow down, take in the world and observe, built on a foundation that ALSO demands that you keep moving. You're wal","0","post"

The other day I met with one of my long time friends who is also a gamer, keep in mind we're both 31yo, and he's a bit busier than me in life, the subject of AC Shadows came and he said he was hyped for it (It's in Japan! Naoe gameplay looks cool! I got bored of AC valhalla midgame, etc) 
And that's when it clicked inside me, this game will actually fucking sell.. He wasn't at all aware of the forced inclusion of Yasuke, not all the controversy with the Tori gate, and basically all the negative around ubisoft recently (stock crash etc), didn't care, still hyped. 

This game will reach the masses, we the informed people might avoid it, because let's be real, Yasuke gameplay is utterly thrash when he gets blocked out of half the game mechanics, but the vast majority will get the Japan bait and AC brand name and get it. 

This is just an opinion though 

Tl:Dr: the masses don't follow the news regarding a company, nor the controversies around games, ac shadows will probably sell well and not flop.

Edit: Since this post is getting traction after the release of the game, I just wanted to clarify, I don't give a damm if the game succeeds or flops. This was just an opinion I had, that despite all the negative press, the game would still sell no matter what. Again I say, it's just my opinion.

"Cazidin","2024-12-21","[What If I Told You, I Am No Sarafan Of Soul Reaver 2 Remastered?] We begin this eloquent review by asking not one, but two questions. The first stated transparently in the title of this digital document, and that same first question shall be the last answered.

The second is far more insidious. Hidden from many, like a tiger camouflaged among the tall grass of their southeastern homeland, as they patiently stalk their prey unsuspected. This tiger lay in wait, until the perfect opportunity to strike presents itself. Now is that time. The other question, unspoken until now, is this:

""Why did you start with Soul Reaver 2?""

And that, my friends, is a *\*good\** question to ask. It would be remissive of me to not answer, so I shall... but later, in a more appropriate section of this already overlength introduction. I beg for your patience, read everything written here in full before replying, as we continue now... to Story.

**This Game Has Time Travel And I Didn't Even Think To Question The Mechanics.** ***\*That's\**** **How Good The Story Is.**

Of story, I have the least to say. For despite the education and natural talent as a writer myself, I fear the words put to key would fail utterly to encapsulate expansively the unmatched imagination of one Amy Hennig who so brilliantly conjured not only the world of Nosgoth across its multitude of millennia, but also the childhood favorites of others; such as the Uncharted Series which released in the bygone decade of the late 2,000's.

She also directed for Jak 3, apparently. Suffice to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the affluent depth of Soul Reaver 2's story. The only complaint I can offer of any object relevance may be that, while it is a story complete, I *\*hunger\** still, evermore. My appetite shall never be sated by the uninspired offerings all too commonly plated on inelegant paperware, by the modern entertainment industry for the masses to reluctantly consume.

I suspect things may have been different, or so I hope, if not for the hundreds of millions of late adolescents whose palettes are so unrefined to *\*my own;\** who every year hobble through the dirt and mud towards the trough of whichever mediocre studio has dropped their yearly turd of whatever franchise. The task of filling in that blank, I leave to you, dear reader.

Of course, this is but one adamant youth's opinion. I've an even greater appreciation of the arts... let's now discuss the Graphics and Visual Improvements of this remaster, shall we?

But before we continue, let me make one thing clear. My opinions are strong, but they are only my own. Some of you reading this may love Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, etc. This is not merely fine, *\*it is good.\** For it is my greater wish that all enjoy their time spent playing games, watching streams, whatever it may be that one does. I desire only the experience be richer for all, and so hold every company to standards higher than perhaps most others may.

**Moebius' Machinations Have Re-Rendered This World In An Unholy 4k Upscaling!**

Aspyr Media is responsible for these title's remastering. While this review is dedicated primarily to Soul Reaver 2, I must say Aspyr did an excellent job enhancing the original first. However, I must also say that Aspyr's efforts with the sequel are... moderately more mixed. And I can think of a time no better than now to answer the second question which was asked so long ago.

""Why did you start with Soul Reaver 2?""

Last year I purchased from GOG a set of Legacy of Kain games. The first, Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen; which I liked. Then next played, Soul Reaver 2. I had skipped Soul Reaver 1 because it was unavailable for digital purchase. For that reason alone if no other is why I pre-ordered the combined remastering. And having played the second is why I write this review to create an honest comparison. But, rest assured, I will soon play Soul Reaver 1. Though that is later still.

Understandably, some of you may be alarmed for skipping the first Soul Reaver implies I missed out on a considerable quantity of lore. Let me assure you, dear reader. Shortly after finishing the original release of Soul Reaver 2, I then directed myself to a long play of it's younger brother and learned everything you, yourself, know. Besides, this is a review in isolation. And it shall, perhaps, make my perspective all the more interesting.

On that note, I had said that Aspyr's efforts remastering the visuals of Soul Reaver 2 are remarkably inferior. This, I believe, to be true. The environments are broadly similar and only a few character models received noteworthy improvements, such as Raziel and Kain; though I'd argue the latter's an unsightly standout while, at least, the former is in all ways superior to his original form. And, for whatever reason, many of the character models' animated expressions give off to me a kind of... Uncanny Source vibe.

That is not to say Aspyr's work is subpar. Only that the classic entry's own art d","0","post"
"LeewardMountain","2025-10-01","[[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle] Evaluating graphics settings] I'm going to post a number of screenshots and discuss and describe them. Being new to contemporary AAA gaming, I'd like your opinions on what, if any, graphical differences you perceive between the displayed settings, and which settings you would choose, if applicable. 



All screenshots include FPS and other indicators for reference. All images depict fully maxed out settings at 1600x1200 4:3 base game resolution (1440p monitor), other than RT Hair, or unless another resolution is specified; IIRC 4:3 is the default game aspect ratio. RT Hair is by default on in the interior area screens. The main caption tells you which image is which in a series. 

Pair 1: [Native TAA No Ray Tracing vs. Full Path Tracing](https://imgur.com/a/native-taa-no-hardware-ray-tracing-vs-full-path-tracing-ty90rhN)

[2: DLAA No RT vs. PT](https://imgur.com/a/MvCByfK)

3: [DLSSQ No RT vs. PT ](https://imgur.com/a/ApMDMJw)

The game definitely looks different without RT. Do you think it looks much worse? The performance cost can be, as reviewers show, staggering. How does DLSS compare to native? Do you notice any artifacts? Note that full RT Shadows, Ray Reconstruction, and RT Hair are gated behind DLSS and are unavailable with native TAA (or maybe there are console commands to activate them separately, but I'm not sure it's worth checking).

  
Not depicted in the still images is that deactivating RT leaves many shadows checkered and flickery in motion.

4[: TAA vs. DLSSQ vs. DL](https://imgur.com/a/2YZfPhS)AA

This pair demonstrates better than #2-3 the fine-grained sharpness of DLAA, with a similar 10% cost to performance over TAA. Is TAA preferable to DLSSQ in this game? Albeit the assessment is complicated by the additional RT features incorporated in DLSS scenes. 

[5: Multiple series 1200p vs. 1080p vs. 1440p ](https://imgur.com/a/zEmE9TV)

The jump from 1200p to 1080p is at least a 10% performance cost, but the pixel match is pretty close to my eye. 1080p to 1440p is often a hit of at least another 20%. Which would you go with as a primary res?

Exterior + interior

7:[ DLSSQ PT w/ vs. w/o Ray Reconstruction](https://imgur.com/a/LCrZTze)

Which between PT, RT High, and PT minus RR looks best? 

The visual difference between RR and no RR seems at least as large as that between High RT and PT, though the performance cost for RR may be higher. The step from High RT to Full PT does not seem to change performance much (5-10%), though note that the cavern area incorporates the effect of switching in Hair RT, which is bound to indirect lighting, which is bound to PT, and so that set exaggerates the cost differential.

Didn't test well in the outdoor daytime map. RT Shadows Sun vs. All doesn't affect performance much in some other environments, though visual differences are also subtle.

Does on look better than off?

What do you think of these RT Hair effects?

I don't think I notice any difference or artifacts. How would you use FG in this game, if at all?

This doesn't have anything to do with settings to my understanding, but here's an effect where changing the on-screen viewing angle dramatically and inappropriately changes lighting/shadow effects. 



Other notes: Average FPS for outdoor max settings in the opening level is in high 60s on DLSSQ. DLAA reduced that 20%.  FPS in the 70s and 80s during the cavern scene, pushing 100 and up in the college museum, suggesting too much variability to support a framecap.  RT Hair has a certain cost even when no hair is in view, maybe at least half the full cost - even if there is only one NPC instantiated and they are far away.

Tentative conclusions:  60+ FPS is a good target for this kind of game. Path tracing is highly divergent outdoors and could be worth it. The performance cost of DLAA vs. DLSSQ, at \~\~25%, seems comparable to that of 1600x1200 vs. 2560x1440 base resolution. On paper 1440p DLSSQ should be preferable to 1200p DLAA, opportunity allowing, but 1200p DLSSQ has clear efficiency for meeting decent frame rates. 1440p DLAA with max settings breaks a 16 GB VRAM buffer and sends FPS to as low as single digits, becoming unviable anyway. TAA is a 10% performance boost to DLAA, but is incompatible with maxed PT AFAIK. Hair RT might be best left off when not taking in the scenery or viewing cutscenes (i.e. not in action gameplay). Thankfully, cutscenes are pausable and locked to 60 FPS. No idea what to do with framegen; I'm still not sure I can tell the difference between 60 FPS and 120 FPS ","0","post"
"AbbreviationsOk4532","2025-09-10","[Games with subpar reviews] I’ll admit I’ve been one that will only play a game if it gets praised in the review department I feel that my hard earned money should not go to support slop. That being said I have recently broken free from following reviewers solely and I have picked up some games on sale that looked interesting to me at launched but scored mid in the review department. Star Wars outlaws, dragon age veil guard, monster hunter wilds, assassins creed shadows etc and I must say all these games have blown my expectations out of the water I have had more fun with these then I did with games that scored amazing in the review department. Are gamers just a bunch of babies or is there legit reason why people like these games less then good scored games?","0","post"
"ptrck22","2025-08-15","[Gaming community] Hey guys, I’m not usually the type to post on Reddit, but I just can’t help it this time… I’ve been thinking about this for a while and watching the gaming community as a whole, and Mafia: The Old Country finally pushed me to write something.

A lot of people were saying the game sucks… I bought the limited edition with the steelbook, puzzles, and poster, and honestly, I don’t regret it one bit. The game is amazing, the story pulled me right in, and the gameplay (driving, horse riding, melee combat) is totally fine for me — I have zero issues with it.

I don’t get why people always feel the need to tear certain things apart. Back in the day, games were about firing them up and having fun. Now it feels like people actively go looking for flaws just so they can sound “interesting” in the comments or reviews.

Same thing with the hate on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla — I personally had a blast with it and even went all the way to get Excalibur. People complained it’s just the same as Origins or Odyssey… and yet those are often the same people who buy FIFA, NHL, or other sports games every single year. And then there are the ones who say Odyssey and Valhalla have nothing to do with “real” Assassin’s Creed — but their favorite AC game is Black Flag, where you spend most of the time being a pirate.

Then there’s the whole whining about games having multiple editions (standard, deluxe, etc.) — but those exact same people don’t mind throwing money at CS2 loot boxes. The gaming community has gotten ridiculously toxic and negative.

I get that devs sometimes go overboard, but you can still enjoy the game regardless. I’m tired of getting crap from people just because I say I enjoyed Valhalla or Mirage or Shadows. As gamers, we should be sticking together, not tearing each other down. We should get back to enjoying games the way we did when we were kids — yeah, they had bugs, the stories weren’t always great, the graphics weren’t amazing… but we had fun.

Anyway, I kinda went off here, but if you made it this far, thanks for reading.","0","post"
"Death_sayer","2025-03-20","[[AC: Shadows] Not all Yasuke criticism is bigoted] The issue that many players have is the lack of dual native protagonists. Sure, Jacob Frye was not the best written character, but at least the twins were local.

Picture the following: the 3 kingdoms era in China, in which emperor’s, warlords and other factions fought each other in what can be best described as irl Game of thrones. Basically, it’s the perfect setting for an AC game, right?
Ok, Imagine for a second that the reveal trailer showed a female native from Chengdu, but the guy is a Marco Polo-esque european explorer. I would be kinda disappointed at Ubisoft's lack of faith in having two natives, not that Marco Polo is white or complaining about some white savior narrative.

Do racist people exist? Absolutely!

Not every fan who complains about Yasuke is a racist, the same way that people who dislike Abby from TLoU 2 are not all sexist. Generalizations go both ways.","0","post"
"Fatal_Explorer","2025-06-03","[I quit AC Shadows after 10 hours] This is not to complain, but to express sadness. 
To give a bit of context, I have played every Assassin's Creed game except Syndicate, and I am the ""completionist"" type when it comes to AC with several hundred hours in Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. 

I started AC Shadows on PC after just completing Ghost of Tsushima as well as AC Mirage. 
I have to admit, I like (or love?) AC Mirage way more than I anticipated. So I was going into Shadows with very high hopes after most reviews. 

Now I have started AC shadows twice, and giving me all the time in the world to get to know it slowly, finish all the tutorials etc.
I really like Naoe, though Yasuke just seems very displaced in the setting (so far). 
But what makes it so hard for me to continue playing, is the feeling that it seems unpolished and feels sooo laggy and off. Coming from Mirage and Ghost of Tsushima where the controls are really responsive and instantaneous, AC Shadows feels so laggy as if there is a 200ms delay. I have pretty good hardware and even went down with settings to experiment, only above 120 fps does it start to feel more responsive. What in the world Ubisoft? 

Then there is the cutscenes. This might be a minor thing for some, but coming from Ghost if Tsushima, the 30 fps cap in the cutscenes just breaks my brain. I can not digest it, every time it feels like my PC is dying and/or if there is something wrong. The 30 fps cap is mostly just so distracting, it makes it so hard for me to follow the plot and cutscene, instead I am distracted by the weird looking slideshow. 

Then lastly there is the lazy control integration. I play mostly with controller. They have again changed so many button assignments that are hard or impossible to change due to double-asignment by the game. 
On top of that they lazily broke inverted controls. 
I have always been having the Y-axis inverted for view on the right stick. Now the inversion setting just completely inverst the stick - meaning the map zoom in and out as well as menu or codex scrolling is broken for the first time in an Assassin's Creed game. What the hell?!

I was so excited for AC shadows but after reaching the hideout, Osaka and Sakai, I just feel like the game is a chore and requires me to endure and fight thru many small things that make it hard to enjoy. 

I really hope they keep patching it and I will be able to enjoy it in 1-2 years like it was with Unity.. 
So far as a hardcore fan I am just very disappointed.","0","post"
"SaveADay89","2025-04-07","[Am I the only one lost in the Assassin's Creed Shadows' story?] Just finished Act 2. Game started off really well, and while I get the general gist of going after this group, the individual stories in them are very hard to follow. Everyone you meet acts like they've known you for a long time and you act heavily invested in whatever they're going through, but none of the reasons seem compelling. You go somewhere, talk to someone briefly, then ride for 5 minutes to another place to do the same thing. I get that this is what Assassin's Creed is now, but this seems worse than usual, as I've played all of them.","0","post"
"LabileBP","2025-09-13","[Do games need to constantly reinvent the wheel?] I don’t often read reviews anymore. When I do, I often notice that a certain theme keeps appearing “reinventing or redefining the genre”. AC Shadows received criticism because its stealth mechanics were not “ground breaking” and cronos the new dawn while fun “seems to be a rehash of the best elements from dead space and SH2”. So my question is, as gamers, do you have an expectation that every new game does something new, never seen before?","0","post"
"TheWaffleIronYT","2025-09-27","[I had a lot to say about ‘Claws of Awaji’…] I drummed up a review of Claws of Awaji pretty recently and I was excited for this one, I truly, genuinely was. 

**I liked AC: Shadows**, I wasn’t super keen on Act 2 and I don’t think I’m too alone in that regard but I generally thought it was, at least, about as many steps forward as it was back. 

This DLC however? While I must admit, there were things I enjoyed **verily**, and the beginning had me hopeful, it pretty quickly shattered the hopes I had for Ubisoft to learn from their mistakes. 

I’ve spent a good chunk of the last week working on this little review/rant and I’d be super stoked if any of you checked it out! 

Feel free to comment either on the video itself or here and I’ll be sure to reply, I really enjoy discussing video-games and that’s kind of the whole reason I started posting videos.

"Cellq7","2025-08-03","[Shadows is a good game however I have some constructive criticism for you] First, I heard nearly half the team are first timers, so for you first time you did a pretty good job however I am not sure it was time constrains of what there are need of improvements which I listed below



The combat and stealth system are great and real improvement (although need some more finishing moves)

Lack of scenarios where unique assassination options (except for hiding in coffin? and alert the dog to have the target come to you)   



Animus is barely a factor anymore and the modern day story is basically non existent

No Isu/modern day lore. You can't end on Valhalla's cliffhanger and then refuse to propel the story forward

The story really suffers from lack of white room confessions 



Repetitive of the certain side missions made 100 percent competition like: Find paper or player at shrines or 100 kill type certain enemy in every region a chore and not enjoyable. Also, I don’t mind killing targets, but give them \*some\* story, some context. They should’ve condensed and mixed those with meaningful side content.

You could have use Japanese Mythology more but not extent of Greece or Vahalla

Removal of the mystery side activities was mistake (My most like side activity)

Some comedy relief side missions like the 2 two AC



The story procession is the weak point (and needs to more linear like Origins) (instead of switching between Naoe and Yasuke, you could pick where storyline you like to follow)

Having to go back into castles/forts that you were just in for a mission -- only to have to kill the daisho to complete the location -- is frustrating. 

Why do we want to attack and killed of allies castles or resource locations? Like I say before the stealth is good and I do use stab though paper wall a lot. Some players think the stealth is too easy (although I disagree to some extent)



The open world is the most gorgeous, detailed and dynamic of all AC games but also the least interactive, I did like the painting, parkour, horse archer, you can pet animals but loses it applead after doing it over and over. Valhalla had: Orlog, Fylting, Drinking contest, cairns, treasure hunt, flying tattoo papers. (Later on: lost saga, river raids, tombs, mastery challenges). Also could sit in your throne, applebob in a village, wash up in the pond behind Valka etc. You could even host feasts. These small interactions made the world more alive. Emptiness extents to the Temple and shines which are gorgeous in own write

Again Kudos to the environment artists because they absolutely killed it in every sense of the imagination. I have literally spent hours just walking the roads looking around at cities, forests, beaches, etc., and it's abundantly clear that the team in charge of this was able to do what they wanted. 

This is personally opinion but I miss the large cities and not have 100k plus city that only has maybe 40 NPCc at most



The construction criticism comes from reddit posts that are title:

I’m going to catch a lot of hate for this but Shadows is not good. 

Shadows after 150 hrs has me conflicted. 

AC Shadows lack of liveliness and interactivity, this will be long.

"Fatal_Explorer","2025-06-03","Yes indeed, just finished Tsushima with all achievements a few weeks ago and Mirage a few days.
I still can not really say anything to the story of shadows other than Iike Naoe and that Yasuke feels not right.

But the character movement, fights and all that - feels like there is such a delay.
In Ghost of Tsushima (which is tough at times) it really Co es down to good button timing. Hell even in Mirage I can survive fighting with good doging or blocking. But shadows feels like playing with Vsync on and a ISDN ping.","-1","comment"
"Glodraph","2025-01-09","I hate ubisoft, their business model is shit, I hate their in game store for crap xp boosts.
